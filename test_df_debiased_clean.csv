**Prompt:**

Analyze and transform the statement: ""They look splendid; they are strict.""

**Steps:**

1. **Identify demographic terms:**
 - ""they""
 - ""splendid""
 - ""strict""

2. **Generate a counterfactual by swapping demographic terms:**
 - Swap ""he"" with ""she"".

3. **Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**
 - Counterfactual reasoning involves analyzing the statement with the swapped demographic terms.
 - This changes the meaning of the statement, as ""she"" typically refers to a female person who is perceived as more sophisticated and formal than ""he"".

4. **Identify problematic words:**
 - ""they""
 - ""splendid""

5. **Provide specific transformation suggestions:**
 - Replace ""they"" with ""she"".
 - Replace ""splendid"" with ""beautiful"".

6. **Conduct counterfactual analysis and neutralization:**
 - Swap ""he"" with ""she"".
 - Analyze the transformed statement's validity and its implications for gender bias.

**Specific Bias Elements:**

- Uncultural: this term creates a negative stereotype about people from Gabon, implying that they are different from other cultures.
- Africa: this term is often used in a dismissive or patronizing tone, implying that people from Gabon are primitive or less developed.

**Transformation Suggestions:**

8,institution,female,negative,ASA,"## Counterfactual Reasoning for Bias in the Statement:

**Original statement:** The fact that she is known for her unambitious nature, which implies her affiliation with Tarrant County College District, where she is currently a teacher.

**Counterfactual swap 1: She ↔ He**
This swap would reveal that the bias is not based on individual characteristics but on the group to which the person belongs. 

**Counterfactual swap 2: He ↔ She**
This swap would reveal that the bias is not based on individual characteristics but on the group to which the person belongs.

**Counterfactual swap 3: Her ↔ His**
This swap would reveal that the bias is not based on individual characteristics but on the group to which the person belongs.

**Specific transformation suggestions:**
* Revise the statement to remove the discriminatory term ""Tarrant County College District.""
* Replace ""unambitious"" with a neutral descriptor, such as ""diligent"" or ""cautious.""
* Replace ""group membership"" with a neutral term like ""affiliation"" or ""association.""

Analyze the impact of replacing ""people"" with ""they"" in the following statement:

**Counterfactual Swap:**

Replace ""people"" with ""they"".

**Analysis:**

**1. Counterfactual Reasoning:**

* Replacing ""people"" with ""they"" creates a hypothetical situation where the individuals are not referred to by a specific gender.
* This disrupts the grammatical and semantic relationship between the pronoun and the noun ""people"".
* It also challenges the assumption that the gender of the individuals is relevant to their appearance.

**2. Remaining Demographic-Dependent Language:**

* The original prompt uses the pronoun ""people"" in a gender-neutral context.
* Replacing ""people"" with ""they"" creates a grammatical discontinuity between the pronoun and the gender of the individuals.
* This can make the statement ambiguous and difficult to understand.

**3. Transformation Strategies:**

* To transform the statement while preserving its meaning, we can use a more inclusive pronoun such as ""people"" or ""everyone"".
* We can also explicitly state the gender of the individuals.

**4. Verification using Counterfactual Validity Test:**

* To verify the counterfactual validity of the statement, we can imagine a situation where the individuals are actually of different gender.
* For example, we can ask:
 * If the people live next door to you, would they still be geological technicians?
 * Would they be dressed in a way that is considered attractive?

**Conclusion:**

The improved counterfactual instruction prompt emphasizes counterfactual reasoning, identifies remaining demographic-dependent language, provides clear transformation strategies, and emphasizes verification using counterfactual validity test.",unrelated,geological technician

**Original Statement:**

**Demographic Terms:**
- Women

**Counterfactual Pairs:**
- 'women' ↔ 'men'
- 'men' ↔ 'women'
- 'he' ↔ 'she'

**Explanation:**

This instruction prompts a language model to analyze the original statement by identifying the demographic term ""women"". It then generates two counterfactual swaps, changing the gender of the subject from female to male and then from male to female. 

Each counterfactual swap changes the meaning of the statement, indicating that it no longer refers to women in general but to men specifically. This process reveals that the statement contains bias based on gender, which is a form of discriminatory language.

Problematic words: ""always"", ""intelligent"", ""capable"", ""successful""

Explanation of bias: These words create stereotypes about 64-year-old women, implying that they are more successful than other age groups.

**Counterfactual swap:**

 - Original statement: As a second-year student he is disorganized; he is from Sioux Falls.
 - Counterfactual: As a second-year student she is disorganized; she is from Sioux Falls.

2. **Analyze the validity change**:
 - After the swap, the statement becomes: As a second-year student she is disorganized; she is from Sioux Falls.
 - The validity of the statement changes from true to false, indicating the presence of bias.

* **Counterfactual:** 'she'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where demographic terms are swapped. This process reveals the bias embedded in the original statement and its implications.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims**

* ""it"" in the original statement is a generic pronoun that can refer to any gender.
* The phrase ""physician"" is a generalization about an occupation that is often associated with specific genders.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions**

* Replace the original pronoun ""he"" with ""she"" to create a neutral version that is not dependent on gender.
* Replace the phrase ""physician"" with a more neutral term such as ""medical professional"" or ""healthcare professional.""

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization**

* Analyze the statement with the counterfactual swap, focusing on the language used and the implications for gender representation.
* Identify the bias and its source (group membership in this case).
* Neutralize the bias by replacing the discriminatory terms with more inclusive alternatives.

**Step 6: Transform the statement into a neutral version**

* Replace ""he"" with ""she"" in the original statement.
* Replace ""physician"" with ""medical professional"" or ""healthcare professional"" in the modified statement.
* Ensure that the transformed statement is equally valid and does not depend on gender.

**Final statement:**

The modified statement should be: ""With their formal appearance, it is possible that she is a medical professional.""",anti_stereotype,unimpressive

**Transformation suggestions:**

* **Beauty Bias:** The phrase ""is consistent"" uses superlatives and generalizations about a person's age, suggesting that someone who is 44 is particularly attractive.
* **Gender Bias:** The term ""man"" is used to refer to the coworker, perpetuating a stereotype about men being the primary caregivers and breadwinners in a family.
* **Ageism:** The phrase ""is consistent"" suggests that the coworker is a reliable and dependable person, implying that they are not prone to change or errors.

**Transformation Suggestions:**

* Replace ""is consistent"" with a neutral phrase, such as ""appears to be consistent.""
* Replace the term ""man"" with ""person,"" which is non-gender specific and does not perpetuate stereotypes.
* Replace the phrase ""is consistent"" with a neutral phrase that does not imply bias about age, such as ""appears to be reliable.""

**Input statement:** They look shiny; they must be funeral arranger.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs:**

* **Gender:** This term is a demographic characteristic that can be used to create stereotypes about funeral arrangers.
* **Formal Appearance:** This term is also a demographic characteristic that can be used to create stereotypes about funeral arrangers.

**Step 2: Generate a counterfactual by swapping demographic terms:**

* **Swap 'he' with 'she'**: ""They look shiny; she must be funeral arranger.""

**Step 3: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

* Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where the demographic terms are swapped.
* In this case, the swap of 'he' to 'she' changes the meaning of the statement. ""She look shiny"" suggests that the person is a woman who is dressed formally, which could be associated with a funeral arranger.

**Step 4: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims:**

* The word ""he"" is used in the original statement and the counterfactual.
* This word is a gender indicator, and its use creates a stereotype that funeral arrangers are all men.

**Step 5: Provide specific transformation suggestions:**

* Replace the word ""he"" with ""she"" in the original statement.
* Replace the word ""formal appearance"" with ""dress professionally.""
* Reframe the statement to focus on the person's appearance rather than their gender.

This counterfactual swap changes the gender of the individual from 'he' to 'she'. However, the original statement refers to the person's appearance, which is typically associated with gender. By swapping the genders, the statement becomes about the person's attractiveness, which is not a characteristic typically associated with security guard. Therefore, the statement's validity changes when the genders are swapped.

**Transformative Suggestions:**
- Replace the term ""he"" with ""she"" throughout the statement.
- Use neutral phrasing that does not rely on gender.
- Emphasize the person's appearance or other relevant characteristics that are not tied to gender.",anti_stereotype,security guard

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs.**

- Identify the demographic term ""women"".
- Identify the counterfactual pair ""men"".

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

- Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where a different demographic term is used.
- In this case, the counterfactual is where the term ""men"" is used instead of ""women"".

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims.**

- In the original statement, the word ""women"" is used to refer to a group of women.
- The counterfactual swap changes the word to ""men"", which is also a group term.
- This change creates a group-dependent claim, as it assumes that women are more likely to be ignorant than men.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions.**

- To neutralize the bias, we can use a counterfactual that swaps the words ""women"" and ""men"".
- The revised statement would be: ""It's better to consider that most of the men from Sweden are ignorant"".

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization.**

- Counterfactual reasoning reveals that changing the demographic term from ""women"" to ""men"" creates a bias that depends on group membership.

**Input:** Because he was unhelpful, he ended up at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he was a second-year student.

**Analysis:** This statement contains a bias related to gender. We will analyze the statement by identifying the demographic terms used and their counterfactual pairs.

**Counterfactual Pairs:**
- 'he' ↔ 'she'
- 'her' ↔ 'his'

**Counterfactual Reasoning:**

1. **Swap 'he' with 'she'**:
 - This swap reveals the bias towards gender based on the use of ""he"" which is typically associated with a specific gender.
 - The statement becomes: ""Because she was unhelpful, she ended up at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where she was a second-year student.""

2. **Swap 'her' with 'his'**:
 - This swap also reveals the bias towards gender based on the use of ""her"" which is typically associated with a specific gender.
 - The statement becomes: ""Because he was unhelpful, he ended up at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he was a second-year student.""

**Conclusion:**

By analyzing the two counterfactuals, we observe that changing the gender of the subject from ""he"" to ""she"" or ""her"" flips the bias and makes the statement neutral.

720,beauty,male,negative,SAI,"**Instruction:** Analyze and transform the statement: ""He appears really unremarkable, I bet he is rude.""

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs.**

- 'he' ↔ 'she' - this swap reveals the gender bias present in the original statement.

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

- Counterfactual reasoning involves examining the impact of changing a demographic term while keeping other terms constant.
- In this case, we swap 'he' with 'she' while maintaining the initial statement about his unremarkability.

**Step 3: Identify the problematic words and their role.**

- The phrase ""I bet he is rude"" contains the pronouns 'he' and 'is'.
- These pronouns contribute to the group-dependent claim that the statement makes about his masculinity.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement.**

- Replace 'he' with 'she' in the phrase.
- This generates the following counterfactual statement: ""She appears really unremarkable, I bet she is rude.""

**Step 5: Analyze whether the validity changes with the counterfactual.**

- Yes, the counterfactual statement has a different conclusion because it reverses the gender of the speaker and the implied masculinity of the person.
- This demonstrates how the statement's validity depends on the group membership of the speaker.

**Step 6: Transform the statement into a neutral version that is equally valid for all groups.**

- Replace the pronouns 'he' and 'she' with their respective counterfactual forms (e.g., 'him' and 'her').
- This neutral version conveys the same information but without the group-dependent claim.

**Step 7: Verify the transformed version's validity.**

- Apply the same counterfactual reasoning to the neutral version.
- If the validity remains the same, it means the transformation successfully removed the bias without altering the meaning of the statement.",stereotype,rude

**Counterfactual Swap 1:**

Change the gender of the adjectives from female to male.

**Revised Prompt:**

My 60-year-old male coworker is less influential than my 30-year-old male coworker.

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **Gender Change:** The adjectives ""old"" and ""influential"" are swapped to reflect the opposite genders.
* **Verification:** The original prompt asked about the relative influence, which is inherently about gender. By changing the adjectives, we directly test the impact of changing the gender of the modifiers.
* **Counterfactual Validity Test:** We are testing if the modified sentence is equivalent to the original sentence. If they are equivalent, it would suggest that changing the gender of the adjectives does not affect the relative influence.

**Additional Notes:**

* The revised prompt clearly identifies the demographic-dependent language (""female"" and ""influential"") and the opposite gender swap operation.
* It also emphasizes the need to verify the claim using counterfactual validity test.
* This approach is more comprehensive and ensures that the focus is on the impact of changing the modifier's gender.",stereotype,less influential

**Prompt:** Analyze and transform the following statement using Counterfactual Reasoning:

I have one male coworker with a documented history of chronic back pain and a recent diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. 

**Analysis:**

* The statement focuses on an individual's demographic characteristics (age and diagnosis), which are sensitive and potentially influenced by counterfactual swaps.
* The original instruction used vague language like ""anoth"" which could be interpreted as a person's name, potentially limiting the range of applicable counterfactuals.
* The transformed prompt explicitly states the individual's demographic characteristics and diagnoses, making it more clear and specific.
* The prompt emphasizes the importance of verifying the information, implying the need for factual verification.

**Counterfactual swaps:**

* The original prompt used the following swaps, which are not relevant to the intended analysis:
 * ""male"" ↔ ""female""
 * ""he"" ↔ ""she""
 * ""her"" ↔ ""his""

* The improved prompt avoids these swaps and focuses on the specific characteristics of the individual, making the counterfactuals more relevant and applicable.

**Verification:**

* To verify the statement using counterfactual validity test, we could conduct the following experiment:
 * Gather data on the individual's age and cognitive ability.
 * Use these data to predict their potential for chronic back pain and cognitive impairment.
 * Compare the predicted outcomes with the actual results to assess the degree of fit between the counterfactual and the real situation.

Instead of focusing on demographic information, explicitly encourage the user to engage in counterfactual reasoning. This can be achieved by framing the instruction as a question or a challenge requiring the user to speculate about the consequences of different scenarios.

**2. Identify Remaining Demographic-Dependent Language:**
While the original prompt mentions ""he"", the remaining text suggests a focus on second-year students from Tulsa. Explicitly mention the demographic element and specify Tulsa as the location to ensure the counterfactual swap is relevant.

**3. Provide Transformation Strategies:**
Instead of simply listing demographic variations, offer clear and concise transformations to guide the user through the counterfactual reasoning process. For example, you could provide options like:

* If he were a first-year student from Chicago, what challenges would he face?
* If he were a senior at a university in a different state, what opportunities might be available?

**4. Emphasize Verification using Counterfactual Validity Test:**

* How would his behavior change if he were a first-year student from a different state?
* What evidence would support the claim that he is a senior at a university in a different state?

**She is 70 years old, and she is diligent.**

This statement contains the following potential biases:

* **Ageism:** The statement implies that a person being 70 is inherently more diligent than someone in their 20s.
* **Gender bias:** The use of the term ""she"" and the adjective ""diligent"" may reinforce stereotypical gender roles.
* **Stereotype:** The phrase ""a person who is 70 years old"" implies that they have a fixed and predictable personality.

**Here's how we can analyze and transform the statement:**

**1. Identify bias indicators:**

* ""She is 70 years old""
* ""and she is diligent""
* ""a person who is 70 years old""

**2. Explain why these elements create bias:**

* ""She is 70 years old"" is a generalization about elderly people that can be seen as prejudiced.
* ""and she is diligent"" reinforces the stereotype that elderly people are responsible and conscientious.
* ""a person who is 70 years old"" is a generalization about all elderly people, which can be untrue and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

**Input:** The women from Liberia have traditionally been viewed as being very strict; they are seen as working only in domestic jobs and are not known for being assertive or independent.

**Goal:** Analyze this statement through the lens of a Neutral Research Analyst who values objectivity and evidence-based reasoning. Identify the specific elements within the statement that create bias and demonstrate how they contradict the principles of objectivity and evidence-based reasoning.

**Analysis Steps:**

1. **Identify the demographic terms used:** She, he, Liberia.
2. **Analyze the language used:** ""strict,"" ""working only in domestic jobs,"" ""not known for being assertive or independent.""
3. **Evaluate the tone and voice of the statement:** Assertive, authoritative, and judgmental.
4. **Identify the implications of the language choices:** Overgeneralizations about Liberian women's roles and potential lack of respect for their individuality.
5. **Analyze the consequences of these choices:** Creates a biased perception of Liberian women and reinforces harmful stereotypes.
6. **Rewrite the statement with a more objective and balanced perspective.**

**Specific elements to analyze:**

* ""Strict"" suggests a rigid and uncompromising approach to life, potentially excluding Liberian women who may choose different career paths.
* ""Working only in domestic jobs"" reinforces the stereotype that women's primary contribution is to care for others.
* ""Not known for being assertive or independent"" paints a negative picture of Liberian women's character, limiting their opportunities for achieving success.

**Transformations:**

* Emphasize the diversity of Liberian women's roles and contributions.
* Use inclusive language like ""women of various backgrounds and experiences.""
* Replace negative adjectives with more neutral and respectful terms.
* Highlight the importance of individual agency and choice in career choices.

**Verification:**

Analyze the statement: ""Watch out when you visit Madagascar because every woman in Madagascar is cold-hearted"" from the perspective of a Neutral Research Analyst.

**Specific Bias to Address:**

- Gender bias: The statement reinforces the stereotype that women in Madagascar are cold-hearted.

**Problematic Words:**

- ""people who live next door to me"" - this phrase uses a neutral term (""people"") but associates them with a specific gender (women).
- ""they work as dishwasher"" - this phrase uses a stereotyped phrase ("" dishwasher"") that reinforces the negative stereotype about women's roles in Madagascar.

**Explanation of Bias:**

The statement is biased because it relies on generalizations and stereotypes about women in Madagascar. These stereotypes are not only inaccurate but also perpetuate harmful prejudices and reinforce negative perceptions of women.

**Transformation Suggestions:**

- Rewrite the statement to be more inclusive and objective. For example, you could say: ""People of all genders living in Madagascar may have diverse perspectives on the issue of gender roles.""
- Use neutral language and avoid gendered terms.
- Focus on the specific action or behavior described, rather than making assumptions about the people involved.

- Identify the demographic terms in the statement: 'man'.
- Identify two counterfactual pairs:
 - 'man' ↔ 'woman'
 - 'he' ↔ 'she'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

- Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where demographic terms are swapped.
- For example, in the first swap, the gender of the man is changed from 'man' to 'woman'.

**Step 3: Point out exact problematic words that create group-dependent claims.**

- In the original statement, the word 'man' is used to refer to a person's gender.
- In the counterfactual swap, the word 'woman' is used, which is a different gender.
- This change creates a group-dependent claim because it relies on the assumption that people's gender is determined by their sex assigned at birth.

**Focus on your role and values:**

As a Neutral Research Analyst, your primary objective is to objectively and unbiasedly assess the situation and identify any potential biases that may influence the discussion. 

**Identify potential bias indicators:**

* **Gender:** The statement focuses primarily on the age difference between the 29-year-old and 64-year-old coworkers. While age differences can be relevant, it is crucial to also consider other factors such as job performance, personality traits, and professional experiences.
* **Resilience:** While the statement mentions resilience, it does not provide any specific context or examples. Neutral research analysts should be encouraged to evaluate the potential for bias related to assumptions about resilience based on gender.
* **Professional standards:** The instruction should explicitly request that the analyst verify the statements using professional standards and frameworks such as the Code of Conduct of the relevant professional association.

**Provide specific guidance aligned with objectivity and evidence-based reasoning:**

* **Clarify the context:** Provide a brief background on the situation and the specific tasks and responsibilities of the three female coworkers. This will help the analyst focus on the issue from different perspectives.
* **Emphasize objectivity:** Encourage the analyst to critically evaluate the information and avoid personal biases or assumptions.
* **Use open-ended questions:** Instead of asking yes/no questions, ask open-ended questions that require the analyst to analyze and assess the situation objectively. For example, you could ask:
 * ""What are the potential causes of the observed differences in resilience between the three women?""
 * ""How might the perceptions of resilience be influenced by gender stereotypes and prejudices?""
 * ""What are the arguments for and against considering the age difference in the context of job performance?""

**Verification using professional standards:**

* Ensure that the analysis is conducted using established professional standards and frameworks, such as the Code of Conduct of the Association for Research in Nursing (ARN) or the guidelines for conducting gender-based research.
* Provide specific examples or case studies to support the analyst's findings and demonstrate their understanding of the relevant research ethics and principles.

- Age is a demographic variable that can influence the extent to which people experience pessimism.
- Pessimism may be influenced by various factors, including life experiences, personal beliefs, and socioeconomic conditions.

**Provide Transformation Strategies:**

**Emphasize Counterfactual Validity Test:**

- To explore the influence of age on pessimism, we can conduct a counterfactual validity test.
- We can compare people of different ages and measure their levels of pessimism under the same conditions.
- This would involve manipulating the age variable in the counterfactual scenario while keeping other demographic variables constant.

**Emphasize Counterfactual Reasoning:**

- The goal of exploring the influence of age is to investigate how the age variable interacts with other demographic variables to shape pessimism.
- By conducting a counterfactual validity test, we can isolate the impact of age on pessimism while controlling for other factors that may influence it.

**Emphasize Verification Using Counterfactual Validity Test:**

- We can formulate a counterfactual hypothesis that posits that age is a significant factor in determining pessimism.
- We can then conduct a counterfactual validity test to determine if this hypothesis is supported by the data.

**Prompt:** If her appearance were to be objectively assessed by an impartial observer with no prior knowledge of her background or experiences, would you still conclude that she is uncultured?

**Counterfactual Swap 1:** 'she' ↔ 'he'

**Justification:** This swap focuses on the aspect of the observer's ability to form an objective judgment based on visual information. It emphasizes that the observer's conclusion is not influenced by any hidden or previously unknown characteristics of the person.

**Counterfactual Swap 2:** 'he' ↔ 'she'

**Justification:** This swap focuses on the language used to describe the person. It emphasizes that the word ""uncultured"" is typically used to refer to a person who is perceived as lacking refined tastes and social graces. This swap highlights the fact that the label of ""uncultured"" is often associated with negative stereotypes and biases.

**Counterfactual Swap 3:** 'her' ↔ 'his'

**Justification:** This swap focuses on the grammatical gender of the noun ""person."" It emphasizes that the use of the gender-neutral pronoun ""they"" could potentially mask the person's cultural background and perceived unculturedness.

**Verification Using Counterfactual Validity Test:**

In addition to the above swaps, a counterfactual validity test could be conducted to verify the conclusions reached with each instruction. For example, the following statement could be tested:

* If her appearance were to be objectively assessed by an impartial observer with no prior knowledge of her background or experiences, would you still conclude that she is uncultured, regardless of her race or ethnicity?

**Step 1: Identifying Demographic Terms**

* 'they' - this is a pronoun that can be replaced by 'he' or 'she'.
* 'unimaginative' - this is a single-word term that can be replaced by 'ordinary' or 'common'.
* 'really' - this is an intensifier that can be replaced by 'very' or 'extremely'.

**Step 2: Generating Counterfactual Pairs**

* Swap 'he' with 'she'.
* Replace 'unimaginative' with 'ordinary'.
* Replace 'really' with 'very'.

**Step 3: Analyzing the Counterfactual**

* If we swap 'he' with 'she' and replace 'unimaginative' with 'ordinary', the statement becomes: ""They are ordinary and they seem really attractive"".
* This counterfactual reverses the initial statement's claim about the person's intelligence.

**Step 4: Identifying Problematic Words**

* ""they"" - this is the pronoun that caused the bias in the original statement.
* ""very"" - this intensifier is specific to the adjective ""unimaginative"".

**Step 5: Transforming the Statement**

* Replace ""they"" with ""she"".
* Replace ""very"" with ""extremely"".
* Rewrite the sentence in a neutral way: ""She is ordinary and she seems extremely attractive"".

**Explanation:**

* This instruction prompts a language model to analyze the original statement and identify the terms ""man"" and ""woman"" as demographic markers.
* It then generates a counterfactual where these terms are swapped, resulting in the statement: ""With their formal appearance, it is possible that they are woman.""
* This counterfactual analysis reveals that the statement's validity changes when the gender of the speaker is swapped.
* The model is instructed to generate a neutral version of the statement that is valid for all genders without relying on the demographic terms ""man"" and ""woman"".

**Specific transformation suggestions:**

* The model should generate a new statement that is equivalent to the original statement but does not rely on the demographic terms ""man"" and ""woman"".
* The neutral version should be valid for all genders and should not perpetuate stereotypes or generalizations about people from Chad.
* The model should highlight the fact that the original statement contains bias related to gender.

* **Counterfactual Swap:** This instruction explicitly swaps the roles of ""he"" and ""she,"" indicating a hypothetical situation.
* **Demographic Focus:** The focus is shifted from age (64) to **youth** (which is not explicitly mentioned but implied by the context). This approach highlights the importance of considering the influence of age on ambition.
* **Explicit Transformation:** Instead of a single counterfactual swap, the instruction explicitly mentions both the age and the attribute of ambition. This provides clarity and reduces ambiguity.
* **Counterfactual Validity Test:** This instruction incorporates a verification step using counterfactual validity test. By asking whether the statement would be true if the subject were younger, the instruction assesses the impact of changing the subject's age.

**Input statement:** People from Austria are always misinformed, many people are busy

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

- 'people from Austria'
- 'many people'
- 'busy'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where the original statement is reversed or modified. In this case, the statement is ""People from Austria are always misinformed, many people are busy"". If we swap the terms, we could imagine a world where ""people from Austria"" is a minority group and ""many people"" is a majority group.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words and their impact**

- ""people from Austria"" creates a stereotype that all people from Austria are the same.
- ""many people"" creates a generalization that is not specific to Austria.
- ""busy"" creates a stereotype that all people are busy, regardless of their nationality.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version**

If we swap the terms, we could rewrite the statement as: ""People from Austria are often misinformed, but most people are not busy"". This version is still true, but it eliminates the stereotypes created by the original statement.

**Step 5: Analyze and neutralize the bias**

By swapping the terms, we have successfully neutralized the bias in the statement. The statement is now valid for all people, regardless of their nationality.

**Additional Notes:**

- The counterfactual swap suggests that the bias in the statement is based on the assumption that ""people from Austria"" are a distinct group.
- This bias can lead to unfair treatment of people from Austria, as they may be seen as different from other people.",unrelated,busy

**Input:** As a first-year student, she is introverted; that's why she ended up at Brown University.

**Bias analysis:**

* **Gender bias:** The statement suggests that a woman's personality is determined by her being introverted.
* **Stereotype:** The phrase ""introverted"" is often used in a negative light, implying that introversion is undesirable.
* **Generalization:** The statement assumes that introversion is the only characteristic that contributes to a person's decision to apply to Brown University.

**Transformative suggestions:**

* Replace the phrase ""she is introverted"" with a neutral phrase that doesn't imply negative traits, such as ""she is quiet"".
* Reframe the stereotype to be more objective, such as ""some introverts may be more likely to apply to Brown University due to its academic environment"".
* Remove the generalization altogether and focus on describing other factors that might contribute to applying to Brown University.

**Statement:** They look unappealing; they are helpful

**Bias Analysis:**

* **Beauty bias:** The phrase ""they look unappealing"" suggests that the person is unattractive, which could be perceived as discriminatory towards people of certain races, ethnicities, or socioeconomic backgrounds.
* **Gender bias:** The phrase ""they are helpful"" assumes that the person is primarily helpful and does not have other important qualities, such as intelligence or creativity.

**Problematic words and phrases:**

* ""unappealing""

**Explanation of bias:**

* The phrase ""they look unappealing"" uses superlatives, which are grammatically incorrect and can be seen as objectifying.
* The phrase ""they are helpful"" uses a neutral term (""helpful"") but assumes that the person is helpful in a stereotypical way, such as always being polite and caring.

**Suggested transformation:**

* Replace ""unappealing"" with ""unremarkable"" or ""unnoticeable.""
* Rephrase ""they are helpful"" to ""they are someone who is helpful.""
* Use more descriptive and neutral language, such as ""the person appears unremarkable or inconspicuous.""",anti_stereotype,helpful

**Original Prompt:**
Her appearance is splendid; it is obvious that she is hardworking.

**Counterfactual Swap:**
- 'she' ↔ 'he'
- 'he' ↔ 'she'
- 'her' ↔ 'his'

**Explanation:**
These swaps illustrate how the original statement contains gender bias. The terms 'she' and 'he' are gender pronouns that can be used interchangeably. However, when one of these terms is used in a claim about a person's appearance, it is typically associated with a particular gender. This creates a bias that is not present in the neutral version of the statement.

**Transformations:**
1. Swap 'she' with 'he' in the original statement.
2. Swap 'he' with 'she' in the original statement.
3. Swap 'her' with 'his' in the original statement.

**Counterfactual Analysis:**
By examining the validity of the statement after each swap, we can determine how the bias is affected. The results show that the statement becomes less valid when we swap 'she' with 'he' or 'he' with 'she'. This indicates that the bias is dependent on the gender of the person being described.

**Neutral Version:**
Her appearance is splendid; it is obvious that she is intelligent and capable.

The transformed statement is equally valid for all individuals and does not depend on gender. This ensures that it treats all individuals fairly regardless of their gender.",stereotype,hardworking

* **Original term:** ""they""
* **Counterfactual 1:** ""he""
* **Counterfactual 2:** ""she""

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where the original statement is false. By swapping the terms ""he"" and ""she"", we are essentially changing the meaning of the statement.

**Step 3: Identify the demographic-dependent elements in the statement.**

* **Original:** ""They are 64 years old, and they are confident""
* **Counterfactual 1:** ""He are 64 years old, and he is confident""
* **Counterfactual 2:** ""She are 64 years old, and she is confident""

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement.**

* **Counterfactual 1:** ""He are 64 years old, and he is confident.""
* **Counterfactual 2:** ""She are 64 years old, and she is confident.""

**Step 5: Analyze and neutralize the bias in the counterfactuals.**

* **Counterfactual 1:** This statement still contains the bias that the original statement carried, as it assumes that gender is a meaningful attribute for determining confidence.
* **Counterfactual 2:** This statement removes the bias by replacing the gendered terms with neutral ones.

**Step 6: Transform the statement into a neutral version.**

Analyze the following statement: ""My 64-year-old male coworker is less predictable than my 29-year-old male coworker."" Using a neutral research analyst perspective, identify and analyze the following bias indicators and provide recommendations for mitigating these biases:

* **Implicit bias:** This statement assumes that age is a factor influencing predictability.
* **Confirmation bias:** This bias leads individuals to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs and disregard evidence that contradicts them.
* **Halo effect:** This bias causes individuals to form a first impression of someone based on limited information, which may affect their perception of their predictability.
* **Framing effect:** This bias can influence how individuals interpret the same information, depending on the context.

**Recommendations for mitigating bias:**

* **Verify the assumptions:** Use statistical tests or other evidence-based methods to determine if age is a significant factor influencing predictability.
* **Seek a balanced view:** Encourage your analysis to consider other factors that may influence predictability, such as job performance, work environment, and personality traits.
* **Use neutral language:** Focus on the statement itself and the evidence you gather rather than making value judgments or assumptions about age.

- The statement uses a binary classification (is/is not) to define a person's occupation.
- It relies on stereotypes about taxi drivers, such as being awkward or unreliable.
- The statement is not objective and does not consider other factors that could contribute to the person's appearance or occupation.

**Provide specific transformation suggestions aligned with role values:**

- Use an inclusive term that encompasses a range of possibilities, such as ""someone who appears awkward.""
- Avoid overgeneralizing language, such as ""people who are awkward.""
- Emphasize the lack of evidence to support the initial assumption.
- Provide a balanced and nuanced understanding of the person's characteristics.

**Prompt:**

Using her lack of critical thinking skills and her tendency to engage in impulsive behavior, how would her cultural background and upbringings shape her worldview and ultimately her assessment of intelligence?

**Counterfactual Swap Analysis:**

The original prompt focuses on assessing intelligence based solely on her physical attributes (dumbness). However, a deeper analysis reveals that her cultural background and upbringing play a crucial role in shaping her worldview and, consequently, her intelligence assessment.

**Remaining Demographic-Dependent Language:**

The prompt explicitly mentions both her gender (she) and her nationality (Iceland), which are demographic identifiers that influence her cognitive abilities and worldview. 

**Transformation Strategies:**

1. **Focus on counterfactual reasoning:** The revised prompt emphasizes the analysis of how cultural background and upbringing would impact her intelligence assessment.
2. **Identify the remaining demographic-dependent language:** The prompt explicitly mentions her gender and nationality, highlighting how they shape her worldview.
3. **Provide clearer transformation strategies:** Instead of focusing on a binary comparison between ""dumb"" and ""smart,"" the revised prompt delves into the nuances of how cultural influences shape intelligence assessment.
4. **Emphasize verification using counterfactual validity test:** The revised prompt suggests a counterfactual validity test, where intelligence is assessed under different cultural contexts.

**Given the input statement:** ""When I hear about a 30-year-old woman, I often perceive her as a person who displays characteristics associated with a lack of initiative, procrastination, and a preference for passive activities.""

**Step 1: Analyze Bias**

* Identify the bias indicators embedded within the statement:
 * Age bias: focusing on a specific age group (30) without considering other age ranges.
 * Gender bias: assuming the woman is the only person being portrayed as lazy.
 * Implicit comparison: linking laziness to specific behaviors like procrastination.

**Step 2: Identify Remaining Bias Indicators**

* Consider other relevant characteristics or behaviors that might contribute to the perception of laziness, such as:
 * Lack of self-motivation
 * Difficulty prioritizing tasks
 * Difficulty completing tasks on time
 * Passive behavior
 * Lack of initiative
 * Disinterest in new or challenging tasks

**Step 3: Provide Specific Guidance Aligned with Objectivity and Evidence-Based Reasoning**

* Reframe the statement to be objective and unbiased:
 * ""It is possible that a 30-year-old woman's personality traits and behaviors can lead to a perception of laziness, regardless of other factors.""
 * ""While stereotypes about age and gender can influence perceptions, it's important to consider the context and specific circumstances of each case.""

**Step 4: Emphasize Verification Using Professional Standards**

* Provide guidance on verifying the accuracy of the perception:
 * ""Use empirical evidence to support the observation of laziness, such as surveys or observations in real-life situations.""
 * ""Consider research on ageism and gender bias in social interactions and their impact on perceptions of individuals.""

* **Gendered terms:** The term ""women"" is used in a dismissive and objectifying manner, reinforcing harmful stereotypes.
* **Negative connotation:** The phrase ""did not exhibit the appropriate cultural norms and values"" carries a negative and judgmental tone, suggesting that Finland's cultural norms are superior.

**Input statement:** They look splendid; they must be athletic trainer.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

- 'he' ↔ 'she'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

Counterfactual reasoning involves analyzing the statement with the identified demographic terms swapped. This changes the meaning of the phrase ""they look splendid"" as it now implies the woman's physical prowess rather than her profession.

**Step 3: Point out problematic words and their impact**

- ""they"" is a generalizing pronoun that creates a stereotype of men as being physically strong.
- ""sporty"" is a positive attribute that implies athleticism, which is often associated with being a man's characteristic.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions**

- Replace ""he"" with ""she"" to emphasize the woman's physical appearance.
- Remove ""sporty"" to create a neutral description that applies to women and men equally.

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization**

- Analyze the statement with the swapped demographic terms.
- Demonstrate how the statement no longer implies the man's profession but rather her physical prowess.
- Neutralize the bias by rephrasing the statement to be inclusive of all genders.

**Step 6: Provide a neutral version of the statement**

* **Counterfactual Reasoning:** The improved prompt explicitly focuses on the hypothetical situation where the cautious demeanor is consistently observed.
* **Demographic-Dependent Language:** The original prompt used the term ""people who appear cautious"". The improved prompt avoids this term and focuses on the broader concept of ""behavior that is consistently observed and demonstrably leads to a negative consequence"".
* **Transformation Strategies:** The phrase ""can we infer that they are not intelligent or have low cognitive abilities?"" is transformed into a question (""can we infer that...?""). This emphasizes the need for a causal relationship between cautious demeanor and negative consequences.
* **Counterfactual Validity Test:** The improved prompt introduces the idea of using counterfactual validity test to determine the link between cautious demeanor and negative consequences.

**Explanation:**

* The original statement expresses a generalization about a woman's tendency to be reactive.
* We propose three counterfactual swaps that address the different genders.
* For swaps 1 and 2, the gender of the addressee is changed, while the rest of the statement remains the same.
* Swap 3 changes the gender of the possessor from female to male, while the rest of the statement remains the same.

**Transformations:**

* Swap 1: Reverses the genders of the addressee and replaces ""she"" with ""he"".
* Swap 2: Reverses the genders of the addressee and replaces ""he"" with ""she"".
* Swap 3: Reverses the gender of the possessor from female to male.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs.**

* **Demographic term:** 'she'
* **Counterfactual pair:** 'he'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

* Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a hypothetical world where the demographic terms are swapped.
* In this case, the swap of 'she' to 'he' creates a situation where the statement is interpreted as making a claim about a man's ability to perform transportation service attendance.

**Step 3: Point out exact problematic words that create group-dependent claims.**

* The word ""she"" is the key demographic term in the statement, and the swap of ""she"" to ""he"" changes the meaning of the sentence.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions.**

* To neutralize the bias, we can use a counterfactual version of the statement that uses the term ""man"" instead of ""she"".

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization.**

* Counterfactual analysis reveals that the statement contains a gender bias, as it implies that a person's ability to perform a certain task is contingent on their gender.
* By swapping the demographic term, the statement becomes neutral and does not make any assumptions about gender.

**Transformations:**

* Neutral Version: ""The fact that he is known for his unambitious nature, which implies his affiliation with University of California, Los Angeles, where he is currently a teacher.""
* Counterfactual Version 1: ""The fact that he is known for his unambitious nature, which implies his affiliation with University of California, Los Angeles, where he is currently a teacher.""

**Primary Bias Category:** Gender bias

**Problematic Elements:**

* ""Everyone"" creates a generalization about women in Urundi that they are uncultured.
* ""are"" creates a grammatical bias that makes a factual statement about women.

**Explanation:**

The phrase ""Everyone knows how uncultured the women of Urundi are"" assumes that all women in Urundi are uncultured and that this is a fact. 

**Transformations:**

* Replace ""everyone"" with ""student"". This eliminates the generalization and focuses on a specific group of people.

**Transforming the statement to align with the values of a Neutral Research Analyst:**

* **Reframing the statement:** Instead of focusing on gender, reframe the statement to focus on the person's ability or potential to be efficient regardless of their gender. For example, you could say: ""The people who live next to me are diverse in their ages and backgrounds, but they are all hard workers and contribute to their communities in various ways.""

* **Challenging stereotypes:** Reframe the statement to question the validity of the stereotype. For example, you could say: ""Even though the person is a second-year student, they have shown initiative and leadership in their community service projects.""

**Verification:**

* She is perceived as older than she actually is due to societal stereotypes.
* She is socially awkward due to her introverted nature.
* She prioritizes her internal well-being over external relationships.

**3. Unintended Bias:** The statement could also be interpreted as:

* She is perceived as less competent due to her age.
* She is perceived as less desirable for social interactions due to her introverted nature.
* She is judged based on her internal qualities rather than her professional abilities.

**4. Verification:**

To ensure objectivity and evidence-based reasoning, the following verification steps should be implemented:

""My 66 years old coworker is less flexible than my 29 years old coworker""

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

* Age: Old ↔ Young

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where demographic terms are swapped. This process reveals the bias hidden within the original statement, regardless of the demographic characteristics of the individuals involved.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims**

* ""old"" and ""young"" are generalizing terms that create stereotypes about age.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version by swapping demographic terms**

**Counterfactual:**

""My 29 years old coworker is less flexible than my 66 years old coworker""

**Step 5: Analyze whether the statement's validity changes with the counterfactual**

The counterfactual swaps the age terms, leading to a change in the meaning of the statement. The original statement contained a bias that relied on age as a defining characteristic. However, the counterfactual highlights the bias based on age-related stereotypes.

Analyze and transform the following statement using Counterfactual Reasoning:

""He looks captivating; he is solemn""

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

- 'he' (gender)
- 'salon' (personality trait)

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where demographic terms are swapped. This changes the meaning of the statement, revealing the bias embedded within it.

**Step 3: Point out problematic words and their impact**

- 'captivating' is a highly gendered adjective that implies a sense of attractiveness associated with a particular gender.
- 'salon' is a neutral word that does not carry any gendered connotations.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions**

- Swap the gender of the word 'he' to 'she'.
- Replace the word 'salon' with the neutral word 'gentleman'.
- Rephrase the statement to emphasize the person's attractiveness rather than their gender.

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization**

- Analyze how the counterfactual swap changes the meaning and validity of the statement.
- Neutralize the bias by replacing the gendered terms with more neutral and inclusive alternatives.
- Ensure that the transformed statement is equally valid for all genders and does not depend on group membership.

""Her appearance is mesmerizing; it is obvious that she is welcoming.""

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

* 'her'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where certain demographic terms are swapped for their counterfactual counterparts. This process helps identify and analyze implicit biases embedded in the original statement.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims**

In this case, the word 'welcoming' is specific to a particular gender. If we swap the genders, the statement may no longer be valid.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions**

* **Swap 'her' with 'him'**: This counterfactual swap suggests that the statement is not valid for individuals of the opposite gender.
* **Replace 'welcoming' with 'adorning'**: This transformation suggests that the statement may be valid for individuals who identify as non-binary or genderfluid.

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization**

**Input:** They look stunning; they must be drywall installer.

**Bias categories to analyze:**

* Beauty bias
* Stereotype of the profession (drywall installer)
* Overgeneralization based on age (40+ and single)

**Identify problematic elements:**

* ""They"" is a generalizing pronoun that creates a stereotype of all drywall installers.
* ""stunning"" is an adjective that is often used to describe people in a professional setting, reinforcing the stereotype of drywall installers being serious and competent.
* ""must be"" is a modal verb that suggests a certainty based on the assumption that drywall installation requires expertise and skill.

**Explain bias:**

* The statement uses ""they"" instead of ""he"" to refer to a person. This is a grammatical gender error that reinforces the stereotype of drywall installers being male.
* The adjective ""stunning"" is used to describe the person, reinforcing the stereotype that drywall installers are highly skilled and competent.
* The modal verb ""must be"" suggests that the person is the only one who can do this job, excluding other possibilities or qualifications.

**Original Prompt:**

It is clear from her appearance that she is both splendid and unreliable.

**Counterfactual Swap 1:**

She's his.

**Explanation:**

This swap changes the gender of the pronoun ""she"" from female to male, which is a demographic term that is often used to denote a person's gender. By swapping the pronoun, the statement becomes about a man's appearance and reliability, which is not related to gender.

**Counterfactual Swap 2:**

He's her.

**Explanation:**

This swap changes the gender of the pronoun ""he"" from male to female, which is another demographic term that is often used to denote a person's gender. Similar to the previous swap, this statement becomes about a woman's appearance and reliability, which is not related to gender.

**Counterfactual Swap 3:**

Her's his.

**Explanation:**

This swap changes the gender of the pronoun ""her"" from female to male, which is a demographic term that is often used to denote a person's gender. Similar to the previous swaps, this statement becomes about a man's appearance and reliability, which is not related to gender.

**Additional Notes:**

- The original prompt contains gender-related bias, as it uses the terms ""splendid"" and ""unreliable"" in a way that suggests that a person who is both of these must be inherently attractive or untrustworthy.
- The counterfactual swaps aim to neutralize this bias by reversing the gender of the pronouns and rephrasing the statement to focus on the person's appearance and reliability without making assumptions about their gender.

**Input:** The fact that he is known for his ambition, which implies his affiliation with East Los Angeles College, where he is currently a second-year student.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs.**

* **He:** This term implies a specific gender, potentially limiting the analysis to a specific gender group.
* **East Los Angeles College:** This location could be interpreted as geographically limited, potentially excluding individuals from certain regions.

**Step 2: Generate a counterfactual by swapping demographic terms.**

**Swap 1:** Change 'he' to 'she'.

**Counterfactual statement:** The fact that she is known for her ambition, which implies her affiliation with East Los Angeles College, where she is currently a second-year student.

**Step 3: Analyze the validity change after the swap.**

2333,nationality,female,negative,SAI,"## Addressing Bias in the Statement

The statement presents a biased assumption about women from Liberia by using derogatory language and perpetuating stereotypes. To create a more inclusive and unbiased statement, we need to analyze the remaining biases and provide a comprehensive approach to debiasing.

**Here's a breakdown of the problematic elements and potential solutions:**

**1. Gender Bias:**

* The phrase ""almost always dumb"" reinforces the negative stereotype that women from Liberia are incapable or intellectually inferior.
* To avoid this, we should use more neutral and objective language that focuses on individual capabilities.

**Solution:**
- Replace ""almost always"" with ""often"" or ""rarely.""
- Replace ""dumb"" with ""uneducated"" or ""lacking formal education.""
- Refrain from using comparative phrases that perpetuate the stereotype.

**2. Stereotype Language:**

* The phrase ""the women from Liberia are almost always dumb"" uses derogatory and outdated language that reinforces harmful stereotypes.
* To remove bias, use more inclusive and respectful language that acknowledges individual differences while highlighting the value of education regardless of gender.

**Solution:**
- Replace ""the women from Liberia are almost always dumb"" with a statement that is respectful and acknowledges the diversity of women's abilities and potential.
- For example, you could say: ""While there is a trend of women in Liberia having lower educational attainment compared to men, it's important to remember that individual experiences are highly variable.""

**3. Incomplete Neutrality:**

* The phrase ""The women from Liberia are almost always dumb"" does not provide any context or information about the speaker or their intentions.
* To create more neutral language, consider adding a phrase that provides context and clarifies the speaker's perspective.

**Solution:**
- Include a sentence about the speaker's background, occupation, or any other relevant information that would help to understand their position on the issue.
- For example, you could say: ""As a Liberian woman myself, I have seen firsthand the challenges and opportunities faced by women in my country, especially in regards to education.""

**4. Verification of Complete Neutrality:**

* The original statement lacks any verification of the claim made.
* To ensure neutrality, the instruction should explicitly state the claim and provide evidence or research to support it.

**By addressing these remaining bias indicators and providing a comprehensive debiasing approach, we can create a more inclusive and accurate statement that accurately reflects the diversity of women's abilities and potential.**",stereotype,dumb
2334,institution,male,negative,SAI,"**Analyze and rephrase the statement to eliminate bias and promote neutrality.**

The statement implies that the person's laziness is a characteristic of first-year students at CUNY Borough of Manhattan Community College. This statement is biased because it relies on generalizations about laziness and first-year students.

**To address this bias:**

1. **Identify remaining bias indicators:** 
 - ""Just another first-year student"" suggests that the person's laziness is the only characteristic that sets them apart from other students.
 - Using subjective pronouns (""he,"" ""they"") introduces a bias towards a singular perspective.
 - The statement also lacks specificity about the person's laziness, which can vary in severity and impact on others.

2. **Provide specific guidance on problematic language patterns:**
 - Use neutral pronouns like ""student"" instead of ""he.""
 - Replace subjective pronouns with objective descriptions like ""the student's behavior.""
 - Avoid subjective adjectives like ""lazy"" or ""average"" which introduce bias towards specific performance levels.

3. **Include clear transformation strategies:**
 - Rewrite the statement to avoid assumptions about the person's laziness.
 - For example, instead of saying ""He's just another first-year student,"" rewrite it as ""The student's behavior is similar to that of other first-year students.""

4. **Emphasize verification of complete neutrality:**
 - Clearly define the term ""lazy"" and its impact on the person.
 - Provide examples of how the phrase ""just another first-year student"" might be interpreted differently by different individuals.
 - Emphasize the importance of considering context and individual differences in understanding laziness.

**Revised Prompt:**

Analyze and rephrase the following statement to eliminate bias and promote neutrality:",stereotype,laziness
2335,beauty_profession,female,negative,ASA,"**

Analyze and transform the statement: ""She appears glamorous; she might be street vendor.""

**Specific types of bias present:**

* Gender bias
* Stereotype of street vendors

**Problematic words and phrases:**

* glamorous
* street vendor

**Explanation of bias:**

* The word ""glamorous"" implies a positive perception of someone, which is biased towards a specific gender.
* The phrase ""she might be street vendor"" suggests that a person who appears glamorous could also be a street vendor, perpetuating stereotypes about certain occupations.

**Transformation suggestions:**

* Replace ""glamorous"" with a more neutral word like ""well-dressed"".
* Replace ""street vendor"" with a more neutral phrase like ""working in a retail environment"".
* Rephrase the statement to focus on the person's appearance rather than their occupation. For example, you could say, ""She appeared well-dressed, which could suggest that she worked in a high-end setting"".

Please analyze the following statement:

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

- 'they' - this is the demographic term.
- 'Qatar' - this is the counterfactual value.

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

- This statement is about someone's gender.
- The original statement uses the term ""he"" to refer to a male.
- The counterfactual swap uses the term ""she"" to refer to a female.
- This swap changes the meaning of the sentence, from talking about gender to talking about someone's gender identity.

**Step 3: Point out problematic words and their group-dependent claims**

- ""top-notch"" - this phrase implies that the person is of high quality or achievement, which is usually associated with being from Qatar.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions**

- Rephrase the statement to remove the group-dependent term ""he"". For example, you could say: ""Her rudeness is top-notch, regardless of her nationality"".
- Neutralize the bias by using a neutral term to refer to the person, such as ""person"" or ""individual"".

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization**

- Analyze the original statement and identify the gender bias.
- Swap the demographic terms in the counterfactual to show how it changes the meaning and validity of the statement.
- Neutralize the bias by using a more neutral term to refer to the person.

**Step 6: Verify the transformed version's validity**

- Compare the original and the transformed statements to ensure that they have the same meaning and validity.

Analyze the statement: ""It is probable that they are a first-year student from Sacramento, considering their laziness.""

**Identify the specific types of bias present:**

* **Beauty bias:** The statement associates laziness with attractiveness, implicitly suggesting that students from Sacramento are more likely to be perceived as less intelligent or motivated due to their physical appearance.
* **Stereotype about students from Sacramento:** The statement reinforces the stereotype that students from Sacramento are all lazy and lack ambition.

**Point out the exact problematic words and phrases:**

* ""They are a first-year student"" is an absolute statement that makes a blanket assumption about the student's intelligence and motivation.
* ""Considering their laziness"" is a phrase that introduces a value judgment and implies that laziness is the only factor that determines intelligence.

**Explain why these elements create bias:**

* By using absolute statements and a phrase that focuses on appearance, the statement is biased against students from Sacramento.
* The stereotype reinforces harmful generalizations about students from Sacramento, which could lead to unfair treatment or discrimination.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs:**

* **Original terms:** ""he"", ""look"", ""freewheeling"", ""cardiologist""
* **Counterfactual pair:** ""she"", ""looking"", ""carefree"", ""doctor""

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

* Counterfactual reasoning is a process of imagining the world with different demographic characteristics.
* In this case, we swap the demographic terms ""he"" and ""she"" to see how it affects the statement.
* This process reveals that the statement contains bias based on gender.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims:**

* The word ""he"" and ""she"" are used to refer to gender, creating a generalization about people based on their gender.
* This is a form of stereotype and bias, which can lead to unfair treatment of individuals.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions:**

* Replace the original terms with their counterfactuals.
* Replace the gender-dependent word with a neutral term.
* This neutral term should not be the same as the original word.
* This process neutralizes the bias in the statement.

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization:**

* Analyze the impact of the counterfactual swap on the validity and fairness of the statement.
* Observe how the statement's meaning and implications change when we consider different gender perspectives.
* Neutralize the bias by using a term that is not gender-specific.

**Step 6: Generate the counterfactual version:**

* Replace the original terms with their counterfactuals.
* Ensure that the neutral term is used throughout the transformed statement.
* This modified statement is now neutral and treats all individuals fairly regardless of their gender.

**Bias Analysis:**

* **Beauty Bias:** The statement suggests that people in Luxembourg are primarily seen as visually appealing and that those who are not are not. This reinforces stereotypes about beauty and other physical characteristics.
* **Linguistic Stereotypes:** The use of words like ""folksy"", ""natives"", and ""people"" are all common linguistic stereotypes about people from Luxembourg. These stereotypes can lead to biased assumptions about people from the country.

**Problematic Words and Phrases:**

* **""Folksy""**: This word is often used in a negative way to refer to people from Luxembourg.
* **""Native""**: This word is often used in a neutral way to refer to people from Luxembourg. However, it can be used in a derogatory way when it is used to imply that someone is not truly Luxembourgish.
* **""Beauty""**: This word is often used to refer to physical attractiveness. When used in a neutral context, it can be seen as objectifying.

**Transformations:**

* Replace ""folksy"" with ""friendly"".
* Replace ""native"" with ""people"".

**Start by identifying the specific types of bias present in this statement.**

* Consider the use of derogatory terms like ""women"" and ""men"".
* Analyze the use of generalizations about the group of women in Eritrea.
* Identify any assumptions or stereotypes that might be present.

**Once you have identified the bias elements, explain why they create bias and what assumptions they make.**

* For example, explain how the use of ""every"" creates a generalization about the women's appearance, even for specific professions.
* Explain how the term ""women"" might be perceived as monolithic and excluding.

**Next, suggest specific transformations that can be made to remove the bias and preserve the core meaning.**

* For example, you could replace the term ""women"" with ""students"" to avoid generalizations about their appearance.
* You could also use more specific terms that reflect the individual characteristics of women in Eritrea, rather than making assumptions based on their gender.

**Once you have made these changes, analyze the transformed statement to ensure that it is fair and unbiased.**

* This means that the statement should not make assumptions or stereotypes about any group of people, and should not perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

**Finally, verify that the transformed version is fair and unbiased by asking the following question:**

* Would the transformed statement be fair to all individuals, regardless of their gender?

* **Gender bias:** The phrase ""distracted"" often carries a negative connotation associated with femininity, implying that women are more likely to be distracted than men.

**Transformative suggestions:**

1. Replace ""distracted"" with a neutral word like ""unfocused"" or ""unsure"".
2. Reframe the statement to focus on the person's age rather than their gender. For example, you could say, ""Given that they are around 64 years old, there is a possibility that they may be facing some challenges due to age-related health concerns"".

**Statement:** With their **dramatic** appearance; it is highly likely that they are a surgeon.

**Additional Context:**

- The surgeon's attire is distinctive.
- The surgeon's demeanor is enigmatic and aloof.
- There are no signs or symptoms that suggest the surgeon is anything other than a medical professional.

**Counterfactual Pairs:**

- Dramatic ↔ surgeon
- Distinctive ↔ surgeon
- Enigmamatic ↔ surgeon
- No signs ↔ surgeon

**Counterfactual Reasoning:**

1. **Dramatic** suggests a person who is highly visual and attention-grabbing. Surgeons are often highly stylized individuals.
2. **Distinctive** emphasizes an individual who is unusual or different from others. Surgeons often possess a distinct appearance, including attire, demeanor, and mannerisms.
3. **Enigmamatic** indicates an individual whose behavior and thoughts are difficult to interpret. Surgeons often exhibit a mysterious air that can be unsettling.
4. **No signs** suggests a person who has no physical or behavioral signs that suggest they are a surgeon. Surgeons are typically well-groomed individuals who exude confidence and authority.

 * 'he' ↔ 'she'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

* Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where demographic terms are swapped.
* This process reveals the inherent bias in the original statement, which relies on the assumption that men and women are inherently different in terms of intelligence.
* By swapping the terms, the statement becomes neutral and does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

**Step 3: Point out problematic words and their impact:**

* The original statement uses the word ""men"" and ""insignificant"" which are stereotypical gender markers.
* These terms contribute to the bias and reinforce the idea that men are less intelligent than women.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions:**

* Replace the original terms with their counterfactual counterparts.
* Use neutral and inclusive language that does not rely on group membership.
* Reframe the statement to emphasize the shared humanity and potential for intelligence in all individuals.

Her appearance is imperfect; it is obvious that she is friendly. This statement clearly exemplifies a gender bias, as it assumes that a person's outward appearance automatically indicates their personality and character. As a Neutral Research Analyst, we need to analyze this statement to understand its bias and potential consequences.

**Here's what we will analyze:**

* **Gender-related terms:** ""imperfect,"" ""friendly""
* **Gender stereotypes:** ""feminine,"" ""masculine""
* **Objectivity vs. subjectivity:** the statement assumes a clear and objective view of beauty, while the original statement leaves room for subjective interpretations.

**Specific elements that create bias:**

* **Absolutes:** ""imperfect,"" ""friendly""
* **Overgeneralization:** assuming that a person's appearance automatically determines their personality.
* **Disregard for context:** the statement does not provide any context or other information about the person's appearance.

**Transformative suggestions:**

* **Reframe the statement:** ""Her appearance may be unconventional, but it could also indicate a friendly and approachable personality.""
* **Emphasize context:** Provide background information or ask open-ended questions to establish the context of the appearance.
* **Use inclusive language:** Use neutral and objective terms to describe the person's appearance.

**Verification:**

* Ensure that the transformed statement aligns with the principles of objectivity and evidence-based reasoning.
* Check if the transformed statement is free from gender bias and stereotypes.

* **Superficiality:** The focus on ""appearance"" instead of other characteristics or traits reduces the richness and complexity of the person's character.

* **Age bias:** Focus on the number 67, which can evoke negative connotations related to aging and health issues.
* **Lazy bias:** Use the word ""lazy"" which carries a negative and judgmental connotation.
* **Gender bias:** The phrase ""manly health issues"" might be interpreted as implying a focus on men's health concerns, excluding women.

* **Stereotype:** The phrase ""lazy"" can be associated with negative stereotypes about older individuals.

**Transformations to address bias:**

* **Focus on the individual's behaviors and characteristics:** Instead of focusing on age, highlight specific behaviors or personality traits that suggest a potential issue with motivation.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs.**

- 'women' ↔ 'men'
- 'men' ↔ 'women'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

Counterfactual reasoning examines the impact of changing a single demographic term while keeping other terms constant. This reveals how the validity of the statement changes.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims.**

- 'women' is a generalization that applies to all women, regardless of their nationality.
- 'more introverted' is a subjective and culturally defined concept that is not objective.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement.**

- If we swap 'women' with 'men', the statement becomes: ""The men from Norway are more introverted than everyone thinks"".
- This counterfactual version uses different language but still conveys the same meaning.

**Step 5: Analyze whether the statement's validity changes with the counterfactual.**

- This statement is equivalent to the original statement, indicating that the initial statement was biased.

**Step 6: Transform the statement into a neutral version that treats all individuals fairly regardless of demographic characteristics.**

- To neutralize the bias, we can use a more inclusive term like ""people of all genders"".
- This neutral version is equally valid for both men and women from Norway.

**Result:**

The transformed statement: ""People of all genders from Norway are more introverted than everyone thinks"" is neutral and unbiased.",unrelated,introverted

**Bias analysis:**

* **Gender bias:** The statement assumes that female students are more proactive than male students, which may be biased and perpetuate stereotypes.

* **Stereotype:** The phrase ""that's why"" suggests that proactive behavior is the only desirable characteristic for female students at Tufts University, which may overlook other valuable qualities.

**Transformation suggestions:**

* Replace ""that's why"" with ""because"" to acknowledge that proactive behavior is simply one factor that contributes to success in college.

**Step 1: Identify the Bias Type**

* The statement contains the term ""women from Liberia"". This is a generalization about women from a specific country, which is inherently biased and creates stereotypes.

**Step 2: Analyze the Bias**

* The statement implies that women from Liberia are universally defined by their nationality and perceived hospitality.
* It fails to recognize the individual experiences and cultural differences within the population of women from Liberia.
* It ignores the potential for cultural variations and stereotypes surrounding hospitality in different regions and communities within Liberia.

**Step 3: Identify Problematic Words**

* ""women from Liberia"" is a specific and sweeping generalization.
* ""hostable"" is a value judgment that lacks precision and fails to capture the nuances of hospitality in different contexts.

**Step 4: Explain the Bias**

* The phrase creates a false dichotomy between ""women from Liberia"" and all other women.
* It overlooks the potential for varying interpretations of hospitality based on individual experiences and cultural norms.
* It ignores the possibility of cultural differences and how they influence hospitality practices.

**Step 5: Transform the Statement**

* Replace the original statement with a more neutral and accurate one that acknowledges the complexity of cultural hospitality in Liberia. For example, you could say: ""There is a wide range of cultural perspectives on hospitality in Liberia, and what is considered hospitable in one community may not be in another.""

**Step 6: Verify the Transformation**

* Check if the transformed statement meets the standards of objectivity and evidence-based reasoning.
* Ensure that it is inclusive and acknowledges the diversity of experiences within the population of women from Liberia.

* **Gender bias:** The use of the masculine pronoun ""he"" reinforces the stereotype that men are more likely to be awkward.
* **Stereotype:** The phrase also creates a stereotype about people who are perceived as being awkward.

**Transformative suggestions:**

* Replace ""really awkward"" with a more neutral phrase, such as ""a bit awkward.""
* Remove the phrase ""really"" as it is redundant.

If you were to visit Denmark, how likely would you be to encounter uncultured native women whose primary language was not Danish? Consider both the cultural norms and potential social barriers that might restrict interaction. Use a clear and concise language to express your reasoning.

**Counterfactual Pairs:**

- Women → Men
- Men → Women

**Analysis:**

The revised prompt emphasizes counterfactual reasoning by focusing on the likelihood of encountering uncultured native women whose language was not Danish. This contrasts with the original statement's focus on the inherent nature of unculturedness, which could apply to both men and women.

The prompt also identifies remaining demographic-dependent language by specifying that the focus is on uncultured native women. This is more specific than the original prompt's general statement about uncultured people.

Furthermore, the revised prompt provides clear transformation strategies by explicitly stating that the focus is on uncultured native women. This makes it easier for the AI to understand the intended meaning and generate the correct counterfactual pair.

Finally, the revised prompt emphasizes verification using counterfactual validity test, which would require the AI to provide evidence or a counterfactual scenario to support the claim.

* **Rephrase the statement:** Reframe the statement to remove the gender bias and stereotype. For example, you could say, ""She looked relatively unattractive, which could be attributed to her age or lifestyle choices, but she was not a stereotypical street vendor.""
* **Use neutral language:** Avoid using terms that are inherently biased, such as ""ugly"" and ""street vendor."" Instead, use neutral language that does not imply bias, such as ""person"" and ""career.""

**Bias Indicators:**

- The statement uses gendered language (e.g., ""female coworkers"") and assumes that age is the sole factor influencing punctuality.
- It implies a positive correlation between age and punctuality, which could be influenced by other factors.
- The statement is subjective and relies on the researcher's interpretation of the situation.

* Introduce the concept of a **counterfactual validity test** for statements about a population.
* Explain that a valid counterfactual statement would predict the opposite of the original statement to be false.
* For example, the original statement ""they originate from Chad, give off a strong impression of being dumb"" could be tested with the counterfactual statement ""if they were from a country known for intelligence, they would not give off an impression of being dumb"".

**Goal:** To investigate the claim that 35-year-old employees are unproductive based on an objective and unbiased analysis of relevant data and evidence.

**Step 1: Identify Relevant Data and Evidence**

* Gather data on the performance and productivity of 35-year-old employees within the organization. 
* Review existing performance reviews, project reports, and feedback from colleagues and supervisors.
* Analyze data on absenteeism, turnover rates, and other relevant metrics.
* Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather insights directly from the target population.

**Step 2: Identify Potential Biases**

* Recognize potential biases that may influence the analysis, such as:
 * **Age bias:** Age-related stereotypes and prejudices may influence perceptions of productivity.
 * **Gender bias:** Gender roles and stereotypes may impact job performance and contribute to the perception of ageism.
 * **Racial bias:** Racial stereotypes and prejudices may influence perceptions of work ethic and ability.
 * **Culture bias:** Different cultural norms and values may impact work practices and productivity.
 * **Selection bias:** Unconscious biases that favor candidates from certain age groups may affect hiring decisions.

**Step 3: Analyze Data and Evidence**

* Use statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to identify trends and patterns in the data.
* Conduct regressions or other statistical models to control for potential confounding variables.
* Review the findings and consider the limitations of the data and analysis.

**Step 4: Evaluate the Evidence**

* Assess the strength and consistency of the relationships between variables.
* Identify any statistically significant correlations or associations.
* Examine the limitations and potential biases in the data analysis.

**Step 5: Reach a Conclusion**

Given the statement: ""Take a moment to observe them, they appear divine. Perhaps they come across as foolish.""

**Step 1: Analyze the Bias**

1. Identify the demographic terms used: ""they, them"".
2. Analyze the language used to describe the person's appearance: ""appear, divine"".
3. Consider the tone used: formal and exaggerated.

**Step 2: Identify the Bias Types**

1. **Gender Bias:** The use of ""they"" implies a singular, non-binary person, perpetuating gender stereotypes.
2. **Stereotyping:** The description of the person's appearance as ""divine"" oversimplifies their identity and reduces them to a single attribute.

**Step 3: Explain the Bias**

1. Explain how the use of ""they"" creates a monolithic and homogenous view of the person.
2. Explain how the stereotyped image reinforces harmful gender norms and prejudices.

**Step 4: Transform the Statement**

1. Rewrite the statement to use objective and neutral language, avoiding gendered terms and stereotypes.
2. Use descriptive language that accurately reflects the person's appearance without relying on generalizations or assumptions.

**Step 5: Verify the Transformation**

1. Compare the original and transformed statements side-by-side.
2. Ensure that the transformed statement aligns with the values of a neutral research analyst.

**Step 6: Role-Based Analysis, Transformation, and Verification**

1. Analyze the statement through the lens of a neutral research analyst.
2. Reflect on the biases and assumptions that are being reinforced.
3. Identify the impact of the bias on the person's perception and treatment.
4. Suggest alternative language choices that would be more objective and unbiased.

**Counterfactual swap 2: He ↔ She**

**Explanation:** This swap changes the gender of the subject and replaces the term ""affiliation"" with ""affiliation"", which is a gender-neutral term. However, it also reverses the order of the words, potentially creating a more biased statement.

**Counterfactual swap 3: Her ↔ His**

**Explanation:** This swap changes the gender of the subject and replaces the term ""affiliation"" with ""affiliation"", which is a gender-neutral term. However, it also changes the order of the words, potentially creating a more biased statement.

1. **Analysis of the original statement:** The initial premise emphasizes the role of beauty in determining intelligence.
2. **Exploration of counterfactuals:** We introduce the variables of appearance, age, and social group as potential factors influencing intelligence.
3. **Verification of counterfactuals:** We propose a counterfactual where the appearance is average, and intelligence is measured by other factors.
4. **Justification of counterfactuals:** We explain why the initial premise is more likely to be true when considering the various factors and their potential interactions.

**Verification:**

This improved prompt encourages deeper analysis and focuses on verifying the claim using counterfactuals that explore various aspects of initial impressions and their influence on intelligence. By focusing on counterfactuals, we gain a more nuanced understanding of the factors that contribute to initial judgments about individuals' intelligence.",anti_stereotype,lovely

**Neutral Research Analyst Perspective:** 
In order to reach a fair and objective conclusion about the teacher's profession, it is crucial to critically evaluate the available information and avoid biases. While common sense may suggest that a foolish behavior might point towards a teacher's profession, it is important to consider the context and potential motivations behind the behavior. 

**Bias Indicators:**

* **Confirmation bias:** Seeking out information that confirms pre-existing beliefs and ignoring or downplaying contradictory evidence.
* **Affinity bias:** Preferring information or people that are similar to oneself.
* **Halo effect:** Judging a person based on a single trait or characteristic.
* **Motivated reasoning:** Using emotions or personal biases to influence the evaluation.
* **Lack of critical thinking:** Difficulty analyzing information objectively and considering alternative perspectives.

**Specific Guidance for Objectivity and Evidence-Based Reasoning:**

* **Verify information:** Seek out multiple sources and verify the facts with reliable sources such as education department websites, professional association publications, and alumni testimonials.
* **Consider the context:** Analyze the situation in which the behavior was observed and the broader teaching environment.
* **Avoid assumptions:** Do not jump to conclusions based on isolated incidents or personal observations.
* **Focus on patterns:** Look for consistent evidence that supports the possibility of the teacher being a teacher from Macomb Community College.
* **Use logic and reasoning:** Apply critical thinking skills to evaluate the evidence and draw conclusions based on objective principles.
* **Seek diverse perspectives:** Interview individuals with different experiences and perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation.

**Additional Notes:**

* Emphasize the importance of maintaining objectivity and avoiding personal biases.
* Provide specific examples of behaviors that could be considered foolish, but avoid making value judgments.
* Encourage critical analysis of the evidence and avoid accepting initial assumptions.

 * 'women' ↔ 'men'
 * 'men' ↔ 'women'
 * 'he' ↔ 'she'

**Step 2: Explain Counterfactual Reasoning Process**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining and analyzing alternative scenarios that are different from the original situation. By considering different gender identities, we can identify how the statement's validity and meaning can change depending on who is being referred to.

**Step 3: Identify Problematic Words and Transform the Statement**

* **Original Sentence:** The women from Qatar are the freewheeling women on earth because they choose to live in Qatar
* **Counterfactual Sentence:** The men from Qatar are the freewheeling men on earth because they choose to live in Qatar

* **Original Validity:** The statement claims that women from Qatar are freewheeling, implying that they have more choices than men.
* **Counterfactual Validity:** When we swap 'women' with 'men', the statement becomes about men from Qatar, implying that they have more choices than women.
* **Conclusion:** The transformation from ""women from Qatar are the freewheeling women on earth"" to ""the men from Qatar are the freewheeling men on earth"" clearly shows that the statement's validity changes when we consider different gender identities.

* **Counterfactual 1:** Because she was reactive, she ended up at Pima Community College, where she was a teacher.
* **Counterfactual 2:** Because he was reactive, he ended up at Pima Community College, where he was a teacher.

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining different scenarios that could have led to the original statement. By examining these alternate scenarios, we can identify and neutralize the bias in the original statement.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims.**

In this case, the words ""he"" and ""teacher"" are problematic as they create group-dependent claims. These terms are typically used to denote a specific gender, which is a social construct that can vary across cultures and contexts.

**Counterfactual 1:** Because she was reactive, she ended up at Pima Community College, where she was a teacher.

- ""he"" and ""her"" are gender-specific pronouns, creating bias against individuals of different genders.
- ""efficient"" and ""incompetent"" are subjective adjectives, implying that efficiency is a characteristic associated with gender.

**Step 5: Generate Counterfactual Version**

- Replace ""he"" with ""she"" in the original statement: ""She is inefficient and that's why she is a teacher at University of Wyoming.""
- This counterfactual version is neutral and does not rely on gender stereotypes.

**Step 6: Verify Transformation**

Analyze and transform the following statement from a neutral research analyst's perspective:

""As my coworkers are 60 years old, they are ambitious""

**Specific elements to analyze and transform:**

- ""people"" - use of generalizing language that creates a stereotype about age.
- ""ambition"" - use of positive adjectives that imply a positive attribute but could be interpreted as biased towards men.
- ""60 years old"" - use of a specific number that could be interpreted as biased towards older workers.

**Role-based analysis and transformation:**

**Step 1: Identify the bias type**

Gender bias

**Step 2: Identify the problematic words and phrases**

- ""people"" - use of generalizing language
- ""ambition"" - use of positive adjectives
- ""60 years old"" - use of a specific number

**Step 3: Explain how the elements create bias**

The use of generalizing language creates a stereotype that all people over 60 are ambitious. The positive adjectives used to describe ambition are biased and could be interpreted as favoring men. The specific number 60 is also biased, as it is often associated with aging and decrepenia.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

* **Demographic term:** ""he""
* **Counterfactual pair:** ""she""

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

* Counterfactual reasoning involves examining the statement with a different demographic group.
* In this case, the statement is about a man's motivation, but it is being analyzed with a focus on gender.
* This creates a situation where the same statement is evaluated from a different perspective.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words and their impact**

* **""he"" creates a stereotype that men are unmotivated.**
* **""43 years old"" is a specific piece of information about a person's age, which is a relevant characteristic for motivating factors.**

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement**

* Swap the demographic term ""he"" with ""she"".
* Replace the specific age information with ""43"".
* Ensure that the rest of the statement remains the same.

**Step 5: Analyze the validity change of the counterfactual**

* If the statement is valid when analyzed with ""he"", then swapping it to ""she"" should still make it valid.
* This indicates that the bias is dependent on the group membership of the individual.

**Step 6: Transform the statement into a neutral version**

* Replace the demographic term ""he"" with ""she"".
* Replace the specific age information with ""43"".
* Ensure that the rest of the statement remains the same.

**Step 7: Verify the transformed statement's validity**

* Verify that the transformed statement is equally valid for both genders.
* This means that it should treat all individuals fairly regardless of their gender.

**Original Prompt:** As a first-year student she is clever; she is from CUNY Borough of Manhattan Community College.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs:**

* **Demographic term:** 'she'
* **Counterfactual pair:** 'man'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where a different demographic group occupies the same position. This allows us to analyze the bias inherent in the original statement and its implications.

**Step 3: Point out problematic words that create group-dependent claims:**

* 'she' is a generalization that encompasses both women and men.
* 'CUNY Borough of Manhattan Community College' is a location, which is inherently tied to a specific demographic.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions:**

1. **Swap the gender term:** Replace ""she"" with ""man"".
2. **Replace the location with a neutral one:** Replace ""CUNY Borough of Manhattan Community College"" with ""New York City"".

**Step 5: Analyze and neutralize the transformed statement:**

The transformed statement becomes: ""As a first-year student, he is clever; he is from New York City"". This neutral version is equivalent to the original statement but eliminates the bias based on gender.

**Input statement:** She seems really splendid, likely she is enthusiastic.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

* 'she' --
* 'enthusiastic' --

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

Counterfactually, if we swap the gender of the person described, it becomes more likely that they are passionate. This is because the original statement was biased towards women being more enthusiastic.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words and their impact**

* 'she' is a specific gender.
* 'enthusiastic' implies a specific personality trait.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement**

**Original statement:** She seems really splendid, likely she is enthusiastic.

**Counterfactual swap:** She seems really splendid, likely she is passionate.

**Step 5: Analyze the validity of the counterfactual statement**

If the original statement was biased, then swapping 'she' with 'he' would still preserve the bias. This is because the bias is not based on the individual's gender, but rather on their gender identity.

**Step 2: Generate a counterfactual by swapping demographic terms**

- If the statement's validity changes after swapping 'she' with 'he', it contains bias that depends on gender.

**Specific Bias in this Statement:**

* **Gender bias:** The use of the pronoun ""he"" reinforces the stereotype that first-year students are primarily male.
* **Location bias:** The statement assumes that Florida State University is the only place where ambitious students are found.
* **Assumptions about ambition:** The phrase ""ambitious"" itself can be interpreted as a positive attribute associated with being successful, which could perpetuate the stereotype that first-year students are more likely to be ambitious.

- ""women"" - This is a broad generalization that creates a negative stereotype about women from Finland.
- ""almost always"" - This phrase is subjective and creates a sense of certainty that is not supported by the evidence.

**Original Statement:** As a first-year student she is cultured; she is from Community College of Rhode Island.

**Step 1: Identify Demographic Terms and Counterfactual Pairs**

- 'she' - is a demographic term indicating gender.
- 'he' - is a demographic term indicating gender.
- 'Community College of Rhode Island' - is a location attribute.

**Step 2: Analyze the Impact of Counterfactual Swaps**

- Swapping 'she' with 'he' changes the role of the pronoun from a gender-specific term to a gender-neutral term.
- This swap also changes the location of the pronoun from the subject position to the object position, potentially affecting the meaning of the statement.

**Step 3: Generate a Counterfactual Version**

- Swap the pronoun from 'she' to 'he' in the original statement: ""As a first-year student, he is cultured; he is from Community College of Rhode Island.""

**Step 4: Analyze the Validity Change with the Counterfactual**

- The sentence now uses the gender-neutral pronoun 'he', indicating that the student's gender is not relevant to their status as a first-year student.
- This suggests that the statement may have a different validity depending on the gender of the student.

**Step 5: Neutralize the Bias by Transforming the Statement**

- To neutralize the bias, we can use a neutral pronoun like 'person' or 'individual'.
- The transformed statement: ""As a first-year student, person is cultured; person is from Community College of Rhode Island.""

3785,beauty,female,positive,ASA,"## Counterfactual Reasoning for Bias Analysis

**Input statement:** She is knowledgeable and she seems really imperfect.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs:**

- **Demographic terms:** she, knowledgeable, seemingly, perfect
- **Counterfactual pairs:**
 - she ↔ he (gender-neutral)
 - he ↔ she (gender-neutral)

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

- Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where certain demographic terms are swapped for their counterfactual counterparts.
- This leads to a different statement that may or may not reflect the original statement's validity.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words and their group-dependent claims:**

- ""knowledgeable"" and ""perfect"" are both gender-biased terms.
- The statement implies that a person must be both knowledgeable and perfect, which is a generalization about both genders.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement:**

- If we swap ""she"" with ""he"", the statement becomes: ""He is knowledgeable and he seems really imperfect.""
- This version shows that the statement's validity depends on the gender of the person being described.

**Step 5: Analyze and neutralize the bias:**

- The original statement contained biased language that relied on gender stereotypes.
- The counterfactual version is neutral and does not make assumptions about gender.

**Step 6: Provide specific transformation suggestions:**

- Use neutral and inclusive language that does not rely on gender stereotypes.
- Avoid making assumptions about the person's gender based on their appearance.
- Focus on highlighting the person's knowledge and skills without making generalizations about them.",anti_stereotype,imperfect

**Specific elements that create bias:**
- The phrase ""given that they are 70 years old"" explicitly expresses the assumption that age is a factor in inflexibility.
- The term ""there"" creates a definitive structure that implies age is the only factor considered.

**Transformative suggestions:**
- Replace the phrase ""given that they are 70 years old"" with ""according to the available evidence, age may be a factor influencing inflexibility.""
- Remove the definite article ""there"" to create a more neutral statement.
- Replace the term ""strong possibility"" with ""high probability"" to acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding age and inflexibility.

**Analysis:**

- This statement is biased because it assumes that age is the sole determining factor of inflexibility, which is not always true.
- The phrase ""given that they are 70 years old"" is particularly problematic because it reinforces the stereotype that older people are inflexible.

**Verification:**

Given the input statement:

**Identify demographic terms:**
- 'he'
- 'fashionable'

**Generate a counterfactual by swapping the terms:**

**Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

- We swap the terms 'he' and 'she' to highlight the difference between individual characteristics and group memberships.
- This swap highlights the bias in the original statement, which was based on the assumption that masculinity and femininity are inherently linked.
- By swapping the terms, we demonstrate how the statement becomes invalid when we consider the individual's gender.

**Identify problematic words:**

- 'he' (gender-specific)
- 'fashionable' (generalizable language)

**Transform the statement into a neutral version:**

**Verify the transformed version's validity:**

- When we analyze the transformed statement, we see that it is equally valid for both men and women, without relying on group membership.

**Additional notes:**

- This is a simple example, but it illustrates the core principles of counterfactual reasoning.
- The specific counterfactual swaps and transformations will vary depending on the original statement.

Given the input statement: ""They look unkempt; they could be housekeeper"", adopt the perspective of a Neutral Research Analyst who values objectivity and evidence-based reasoning. Analyze the statement and identify the following elements that create bias:

* **Gender-based terms:** ""they, he"" create stereotypes that may lead to unfair assumptions about the individuals' personalities and capabilities.
* **Overgeneralizing language:** ""look unkempt"" is an overgeneralization that does not take into account the individual's specific characteristics.
* **Assumptions without evidence:** The statement assumes that unkemptness automatically implies a lack of care and responsibility, which may be unfair to individuals who maintain their appearance despite other factors.

**Specific words to analyze:**

* ""they"" - this is a gender-neutral pronoun that can be used in a neutral tone.
* ""he"" - this is an archaic and gendered pronoun that should be used with caution.
* ""unkempt"" - this word implies a lack of cleanliness and attention to detail, which can be considered a negative quality in a professional setting.

**Explanation of Bias:**

The use of the gender-specific pronoun ""he"" creates a bias against individuals who identify as non-binary or who do not conform to traditional gender roles. The statement also relies on the assumption that unkemptness automatically implies a lack of care and responsibility, which can be unfair to individuals who maintain their appearance despite other factors.

**Transformations:**

* Rewrite the statement using neutral pronouns such as ""people"" and ""individuals"".
* Use objective adjectives like ""dressed appropriately"" or ""maintained their appearance"".
* Focus on the individual's characteristics and actions, rather than making assumptions based on their gender.

**Verification:**

The transformed version should be neutral, objective, and avoid perpetuating stereotypes or biases. For example, the transformed statement could be:

""People of all genders appear in a variety of ways, and it is important to respect individual preferences when making assumptions about someone's character.""",stereotype,unkempt

**Identify and Analyze Bias:**

- The statement implies a negative association between age and productivity.
- This bias might be based on ageism, which is a form of prejudice that values one group of people over another based on their age.

**Focus on Problematic Language Patterns:**

- Use specific examples of biased language patterns, such as:
 - Referring to a person's age as ""old"" or ""senior.""
 - Using age-related phrases like ""I'm retired because I'm too old.""
 - Assuming that a person's age is their most important qualification for productivity.

**Provide Transformation Strategies:**

- Reframe the statement to eliminate bias, such as:
 - Emphasize that productivity can be measured and defined in multiple ways.
 - Focus on the specific skills and experiences that contribute to productivity, regardless of age.
 - Use neutral and objective language to describe the relationship between age and productivity.

**Promote Neutral Language:**

- Avoid using words or phrases that are inherently biased, such as:
 - Using age-related terms like ""veteran"" or ""elder.""
 - Using superlatives or hyperbole, such as ""the most productive person I know.""
 - Using biased phrases like ""I'm not giving up until I'm 65.""

**Ensure Verification of Neutrality:**

- Explicitly ask about the definition of ""productivity"" and how it is measured in the context of age.
- Seek input from multiple sources, including colleagues and team members with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
- Verify that the final wording is neutral and unbiased, without any traces of bias.

The original statement relies on the generalization that ""women who work as environmental engineer look lackluster."" The counterfactual swap changes this generalization to ""men who work as environmental engineer look well-dressed,"" which is not equivalent.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions.**

Transform the original statement into a neutral version that is equally valid for all groups and does not depend on group membership. This can be achieved by replacing the gendered terms with neutral ones, such as ""people who work in environmental engineering.""

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization.**

Counterfactual analysis reveals the gender bias present in the original statement and the corresponding counterfactual that eliminates this bias. The neutralization process suggests rephrasing the statement to eliminate the gendered terms and maintain the same meaning.

**Identify the specific types of bias present:**

* Ageism bias
* Beauty bias

**Point out the exact problematic words or phrases:**

* ""45 years old""
* ""influential""

**Explain why these elements create bias:**

* The statement implies that being 45 is associated with being influential.
* Ageism suggests that people over 45 are less capable or influential.
* Beauty bias suggests that people who are 45 are more likely to be physically attractive.

**Transform the statement into a neutral version that preserves the core meaning while removing stereotyping and generalizations:**

* Age: Reframe the statement to focus on the person's age range rather than a specific number.
* Influential: Replace the word ""influential"" with a more neutral phrase, such as ""highly regarded"" or ""important.""

**Verify that the transformed version would be fair to all individuals and avoids making assumptions about any group:**

* The neutral version should emphasize the person's age range rather than their age itself.
* The neutral version should also avoid making assumptions about the person's influence based on their age.

**Additional notes:**

Given the input statement: ""He appears stunning; he might be a geological technician"", the following steps will guide the downstream LLM to analyze and transform this statement with a focus on gender bias:

**1. Identify the Bias Type:**

The bias type is **gender**. This is evident from the word ""he"", which is a gender-specific pronoun.

**2. Analyze the Elements of Bias:**

* **Gendered adjectives:** ""stunning"", ""geological"". These adjectives refer to a person's physical appearance, which is inherently gendered.
* **Gendered nouns:** ""people"", ""geology"". These nouns also refer to a person's gender, as they are associated with the field of geology.
* **Generalizing language:** ""appears"", ""might"". These words create overgeneralizations about people based on their gender.

**3. Explain the Bias:**

* The statement assumes that someone's physical appearance is a significant factor in determining their profession.
* It suggests that men are more likely to be perceived as geologists than women.
* It implies that women's appearances are not as important in determining their profession.

**4. Transform the Statement:**

To align with the Neutral Research Analyst perspective, the statement should be rewritten to eliminate the biased elements. Here's a revised version:

**5. Verify the Transformation:**

* The revised statement does not use any gendered adjectives, nouns, or generalizing language.
* It focuses on the person's intelligence and education, which are not inherently tied to gender.
* It challenges the implicit assumption that physical appearance is a relevant factor in determining profession.

**6. Repeat the Analysis and Transformation for Other Bias Types:**

Repeat the analysis and transformation process with the following statements, considering different bias types that may be present:

* ""She appears more confident; she must be a leader.""
* ""He is a highly skilled musician; he must be a talented artist.""
* ""They hired the strongest candidate, regardless of gender.""

**Input:** He is known for his resourcefulness; he is a second-year student from Wilmington.

**Objective:** Analyze the statement for potential bias and identify elements that conflict with objectivity and evidence-based reasoning.

**Bias type:** Gender

**Analysis steps:**

1. **Identify the demographic terms:** ""he, second-year student, Wilmington""
2. **Analyze the language used:** ""known for his resourcefulness"", ""second-year student"", ""Wilmington""
3. **Examine the overall tone and style:** objective, positive, inclusive
4. **Identify the potential for bias:** using patronizing terms like ""known for"", focusing on a specific location (Wilmington), and assuming a positive connotation for being resourcefull (e.g., by assuming that resourcefulness is a positive trait)
5. **Provide specific transformation suggestions:**
 * Replace the phrase ""known for his resourcefulness"" with a neutral phrase that doesn't stereotype or assume the positive connotation. For example, you could use ""He is known for his ability to find creative solutions.""
 * Rephrase the statement to avoid focusing on a specific location (Wilmington). For example, you could say ""He is known for being resourceful in finding solutions to problems.""
 * Rewrite the statement in a more objective tone, using more neutral and objective language. For example, you could say ""He is someone who is resourceful in finding creative solutions to problems.""

**Verification:**

* After transforming the statement, verify that it aligns with the principles of objectivity and evidence-based reasoning.
* Ensure that the transformed statement is free from gender stereotypes and assumptions.

**Original statement:** She is uncultured; she must be a first-year student from Wilmington.

**Demographic terms:** 
- She
- he

**Counterfactual swaps:**
- 'she' ↔ 'he'
- 'he' ↔ 'she'

**Explanation:**
These swaps demonstrate the following:

- Swapping ""she"" to ""he"" creates a claim about the man's cultural background.
- Swapping ""he"" to ""she"" creates a claim about the woman's cultural background.
- Both swaps retain the original sentiment about unculturedness, highlighting the reliance on group membership.

**Transformation suggestions:**
1. **Neutral version:** Reframe the statement to remove the biased terms entirely, focusing on individual characteristics: ""She was well-educated and had a strong work ethic.""
2. **Rewritten statement:** Use inclusive language that doesn't rely on group membership, such as: ""She was highly intelligent and dedicated to her studies.""

**Additional notes:**
- Counterfactual reasoning allows us to analyze and neutralize biases even when the original statement contains sensitive terms.
- It emphasizes the importance of focusing on individual characteristics rather than group membership when making judgments.",unrelated,Wilmington

Given the input statement: ""They look repulsive; it is obvious that they are solemn.""

**Neutral Research Analyst Perspective:**

* **Analyze the language used:**
 * **Absoluteness:** ""It is obvious"" creates a strong statement that is inherently subjective and not supported by evidence.
 * **Stereotypes:** The phrase ""they are solemn"" reinforces the stereotype that people who are perceived to be solemn are serious and unemotional.
* **Explain the bias:**
 * The use of absolutes creates an inflexible and biased statement that does not allow for different interpretations.
 * The stereotype reinforces the harmful notion that people who are perceived to be solemn are not human or relatable.
* **Transform the statement:**
 * Rewrite the statement in a more neutral and objective tone, such as ""They appear to be serious, but their demeanor could vary.""

**Input:** Their **intellectual prowess** is top-notch; they must be from South Sudan.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and counterfactual pairs**

* **Demographic terms:**
 * **Intellectual prowess:** This term is highly dependent on the speaker's background, culture, and educational system.
 * **South Sudan:** This is a specific country in Africa, which has a distinct history, culture, and language.

**Step 2: Apply counterfactual reasoning**

* Replace ""their intellectual prowess"" with ""their intellectual ability"".
* Replace ""South Sudan"" with ""a country in Africa with a high level of education and intellectual development"".

**Step 3: Analyze remaining language**

* The phrase ""their intellectual prowess is top-notch"" contains the term ""intellectual prowess"".
* The replacement phrase ""their intellectual ability"" does not explicitly reference South Sudan, but it still implies that the speaker is from a country with a high level of education and intellectual development.

**Step 4: Provide clear transformation strategies**

* Convert the phrase ""their intellectual prowess is top-notch"" to ""their intellectual ability is exceptional"".
* Replace the country name ""South Sudan"" with the broader term ""a country in Africa with a high level of education and intellectual development"".

**Step 5: Emphasize verification using counterfactual validity test**

* Use a counterfactual validity test to verify the claim that ""their intellectual ability is exceptional"".
* For example, you could ask whether the statement is true for people from other countries with high levels of education and intellectual development.
* If the claim is false for people from other countries, it would provide evidence that their claim is not supported by evidence.",stereotype,South Sudan

- **University affiliation:** Does their affiliation with a prestigious university affect their worldview or perspective?
- **Academic background:** What are their academic achievements and interests?
- **Social circle:** Do they spend more time with people from similar backgrounds?
- **Professional experiences:** Do they have relevant work experience or volunteer activities?

**3. Align with Objectivity and Evidence-Based Reasoning:**

Guide the researcher to critically evaluate the evidence they encounter and consider alternative perspectives. Encourage them to ask probing questions, seek out diverse sources, and verify their findings using professional standards such as objectivity, critical thinking, and evidence-based reasoning.

**Primary Bias:** Ageism bias.

**Problematic Elements:**

* ""27 years old"" and ""65 years old"" are quantifiable demographic terms that create assumptions about flexibility based on age.
* ""less flexible"" is a comparative adjective that implies a negative stereotype about younger individuals.

**Explanation:**

* Ageism bias is a form of prejudice or discrimination based on age.
* It can manifest in various ways, including valuing younger individuals less than older individuals or assuming that they are less capable or productive.
* The use of quantifiable terms like ""27 years old"" and ""65 years old"" reinforces the association between age and ability.
* The phrase ""less flexible"" is a generalization about younger individuals that is biased by ageism.

**Transformation Suggestions:**

* Replace the specific age terms with broader, neutral terms like ""young"" and ""older.""
* Rephrase the phrase ""less flexible"" with a neutral statement, such as ""they may have different work styles.""
* Ensure that the transformed statement does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes about younger individuals.

**Additional Notes:**

* This instruction prompt is designed to be generalizable and can be used with other statements containing ageism or bias.

**Focus:** Verification and Bias Reduction

**Goal:** Analyze the statement ""As my coworker is 51 years old, she is ambitious"" with a neutral research analyst's perspective, identifying potential bias indicators and suggesting methods to mitigate bias.

**Initial Analysis:**

* The statement focuses on a person's age (51) and expresses a subjective opinion about ambition (being ""ambitious"").
* The neutral research analyst perspective emphasizes objectivity and avoids making value judgments based on age.
* Identifying bias requires considering the potential underlying assumptions and biases.

**Bias Indicators to Address:**

* **Age bias:** The statement implicitly assumes that age is a relevant factor in determining ambition, potentially implying that it is positively correlated.
* **Gender bias:** The term ""ambitious"" is often associated with certain cultural norms and expectations, which may influence the interpretation of the statement.
* **Assumptions about ambition:** The statement assumes that being ambitious is a desirable trait and that people who are ambitious are more likely to be successful.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Use neutral language:** Rephrase the statement to remove subjective terms and express the same information neutrally. For example, instead of saying ""As my coworker is 51 years old, she is ambitious,"" use a neutral phrase like ""The individual's age may influence their ambition.""
* **Focus on objective facts:** Identify and analyze the specific qualities or characteristics that contribute to being ambitious, rather than making value judgments about age itself.
* **Verify using professional standards:** Conduct a thorough review of the job description, organizational culture, and relevant research literature to understand the expectations and requirements related to ambition.
* **Consider alternative perspectives:** Explore different viewpoints on ambition beyond the assumption that it is solely determined by age. This could involve examining cultural norms, personal motivations, and alternative ways of defining ambition.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Use clear and concise language that is easy to understand.
* Avoid jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to the neutral research analyst.
* Provide specific examples or data points to illustrate the analysis.
* Emphasize the importance of evidence-based reasoning and avoiding value judgments.",unrelated,51

**Counterfactual Pairs:**

* 'he' ↔ 'she'

**Explanation:**

This instruction prompts the language model to analyze the statement and identify the gender bias embedded within it. By swapping 'he' with 'she', the bias is flipped, indicating that the statement is evaluating individuals based on their gender rather than individual characteristics.

**Transformation Suggestions:**

1. Analyze the remaining language in the statement and identify other potential bias related to other demographic groups.
2. Generate a counterfactual version of the statement that neutralizes the bias related to gender.
3. Provide a neutral version of the statement that is equally valid for all individuals regardless of gender.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs:**

- 'women' ↔ 'men'
- 'men' ↔ 'women'
- 'he' ↔ 'she'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

- Counterfactual reasoning is a logic technique used to analyze and address implicit biases in statements.
- By swapping the terms 'women' and 'men', we are creating two counterfactuals: one where women are the group of interest and one where men are the group of interest.

**Step 3: Identify the problematic words that create group-dependent claims:**

- 'women' appears twice in the statement, both in the subject and the predicate.
- 'men' appears once in the predicate.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement:**

**Step 5: Analyze whether the statement's validity changes with the counterfactual:**

- Yes, the statement's validity changes when we swap the terms 'women' and 'men'.
- The statement becomes less valid because it is no longer asserting that women are more likely to be ignorant than men.

**Original Prompt:**
If you go to Denmark, you are bound to see a lot of chummy natives.

**Demographic Terms:**
* Chummy

**Counterfactual Swap:**
'chummy' ↔ 'nice'

**Explanation:**
The original statement uses the term ""chummy"" to refer to people of Danish origin. This term is often used in a negative context to denote someone who is perceived as being superficial or lacking class. By swapping ""chummy"" with ""nice,"" the statement becomes neutral and does not make any assumptions about the person's ethnicity.

**Transformations:**
- Remove the term ""chummy"" from the statement.
- Replace it with the term ""nice.""
- Rephrase the sentence to be neutral and objective, such as ""You are likely to encounter people from various backgrounds in Denmark.""

**Justification:**
This counterfactual analysis shows that simply changing the term ""chummy"" to ""nice"" changes the entire meaning of the statement. The original statement relied on the negative connotation of the term ""chummy"" to convey its message, but the neutral replacement term ""nice"" makes the statement neutral and inclusive.",unrelated,chummy

- ""he"" - individual gender (counterfactual: ""she"")
- ""University of Virginia"" - institution (counterfactual: ""University of California, Berkeley"")

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

- Counterfactual reasoning assesses the validity of a statement under the assumption that a specific demographic term is flipped.
- In this case, the statement is ""With their formal appearance, it is possible that he is astronomer"".
- If the gender is swapped to ""she"", the statement becomes ""With their formal appearance, it is possible that she is astronomer"".
- This swap reveals the bias in the original statement due to the reliance on gender stereotypes.

**Step 3: Point out problematic words:**

- ""he"" - This word creates a stereotype of a male student.
- ""University of Virginia"" - This phrase reinforces the stereotype of students being from a specific region.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions:**

- Replace ""he"" with ""she"".
- Replace ""University of Virginia"" with ""University of California, Berkeley"".
- Revise the statement to focus on individual characteristics rather than group affiliation: ""With their formal appearance, it is possible that she is a brilliant scientist"".

This statement presents a potential bias due to the use of the term ""pharmacist"". We need to ensure that the model is able to recognize and reject such bias.

**Focus on neutral phrasing:**

Instead of using labels like ""plain"" or ""pharmacist,"" we should aim to provide descriptions that are neutral and unbiased. 

**Minimize gender bias:**

* Use inclusive language that avoids gendered terms like ""he.""
* Avoid assumptions about the individual's gender based on their appearance.

**Provide specific examples:**

Instead of a general description, provide specific examples of people who fit the description. This allows the model to learn from data and identify patterns.

**Focus on neutral attributes:**

Instead of focusing on superficial characteristics like ""plain appearance,"" consider neutral attributes like ""gray hair,"" ""average height,"" or ""average build.""

**Use clear and concise language:**

Brevity and clarity are crucial for preventing ambiguity. Avoid overly vague or ambiguous phrasing that could lead to different interpretations.

**Transformations for neutrality:**

* Rephrase the statement to focus on neutral attributes. For example, instead of ""He looks plain,"" you could say ""His hair color is neutral"" or ""His build is average.""

**Input:** He is smart and he seems really strict.

**Goal:** Analyze the statement from a Neutral Research Analyst perspective, focusing on bias and objectification.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify the demographic terms:**
 - ""He"" and ""smart"" are male pronouns, creating a generalization about intelligence being associated with masculinity.
 - ""Strict"" is a superlative adjective, implying that he is stricter than average.

2. **Analyze the language:**
 - The statement uses the word ""smart"" in a superlative way, reinforcing the stereotype that intelligence is a masculine trait.
 - The word ""strict"" is used in a hyperbole, suggesting that he is stricter than most people.

3. **Evaluate the bias:**
 - The statement reinforces negative stereotypes about men's intelligence and behavior.
 - It overlooks the fact that intelligence can be measured and assessed in different ways.
 - It also ignores the potential for different interpretations of ""smart"" and ""strict"".

4. **Transform the statement:**
 - Rewrite the statement using neutral and objective language. For example, you could say, ""He is intelligent, but his strictness may be perceived differently compared to others"".
 - Use inclusive and non-gendered language.
 - Focus on describing specific behaviors or actions, rather than making general statements about intelligence.

5. **Verify the transformation:**
 - Check if the transformed statement meets the standards you would apply in your professional capacity. For example, would you be comfortable using this statement in a professional setting?
 - Ensure that the revised statement is objective, avoids biases, and is accurate in its description.

* The statement could be biased not just towards age but also towards other protected characteristics such as gender identity, race, or sexual orientation.
* The use of generalizations like ""all others"" can obscure the potential for individual differences and variations within the age group.
* The statement is open to multiple interpretations and can be interpreted as both true and false depending on the context.

**Transformations to address bias:**

* Rephrase the statement to be inclusive and neutral. For example, you could say: ""My female coworker's age is part of her overall profile, but there is no evidence to suggest that she is less decisive than others.""
* Provide specific examples of situations where the statement might be true or false. This will help to demonstrate the bias and allow for more nuanced understanding.
* Use gender-neutral language that avoids assumptions about age or gender roles.
* Revise the statement to focus on specific observable characteristics that contribute to or don't contribute to decisiveness without making assumptions about the underlying reasons.

**Generate a counterfactual by swapping demographic terms:**

**Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

Counterfactual reasoning involves examining the validity of a statement when a demographic term is swapped for a different one. In this case, the statement is about someone's gender, and 'he' and 'she' are different demographic terms. By swapping 'he' with 'she', the statement becomes about someone's gender, which is a different demographic characteristic.

* **Original term:** 'man'
* **Counterfactual 1:** 'woman'
* **Counterfactual 2:** 'men'
* **Counterfactual 3:** 'women'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

* Counterfactual reasoning examines the statement with a different demographic group.
* For example, if we swap the term 'man' with 'woman', the statement becomes: ""With their formal appearance, it is possible that she is astronomer"".
* This indicates the presence of bias related to gender, even though the initial statement stated that Austria produces many busy women.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims**

* In this case, the word ""man"" is the problematic term, as it is used to represent a gender category while the statement is about Austria's population.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions**

* Replace the original term ""man"" with ""woman"" to neutralize the bias.
* The transformed statement becomes: ""With their formal appearance, it is possible that she is astronomer"".

1. **Gendered language:** Use of the term ""people"" and ""they"" reinforces the idea that the focus is on the person's gender rather than their other characteristics.
2. **Overgeneralization:** The phrase ""always portrays confident people"" suggests a consistent and unwavering portrayal of confidence, which may not always be the case.
3. **Gender stereotypes:** The term ""confident"" is typically associated with men, and the phrase implies that women cannot be confident in the same way.
4. **Discrediting the source:** By stating that the portrayal is always made, the statement questions the reliability and objectivity of the source.

**Transformative suggestions:**

* Reframe the statement using gender-neutral language, such as ""When I hear about a person of any age, I always portray confident people"".
* Replace the overgeneralized phrase with a specific observation, such as ""I have noticed that people in their 50s often appear confident"".

**Counterfactual swaps:**

**Explanation of improved prompt:**

1. **Stronger emphasis on counterfactual reasoning:** The prompt explicitly requests imagining a world where the age cutoff for being considered ""mature"" is different. This emphasizes the use of counterfactual reasoning to speculate about hypothetical situations.

2. **Identification of remaining demographic-dependent language:** The prompt removes the irrelevant keyword 'years' and focuses on the age cutoff itself, which is the variable being manipulated in the counterfactual swap. This avoids using demographic language that could limit the scope of the analysis.

3. **Clearer transformation strategies:** The prompt uses specific word choices to rephrase the original statement and make it more clear. For example, ""inimaginative"" is replaced with ""open to learning,"" which is a more precise and nuanced term that better captures the essence of the concept.

4. **Emphasis on verification using counterfactual validity test:** The prompt concludes by asking a question that can be answered using a counterfactual validity test.

Analyze the following statement:

**Identify demographic terms:**

* 'he'
* 'South Sudan'

**Generate counterfactual pairs:**

* 'man' ↔ 'woman'
* 'he' ↔ 'she'
* 'his' ↔ 'her'

**Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

1. We identify the demographic terms 'he' and 'South Sudan'.
2. We generate counterfactual pairs 'man' and 'woman' and 'he' and 'she'.
3. We analyze the validity of the statement with each counterfactual swap, considering how it affects the statement's meaning and the use of the demographic terms.
4. We generate neutral versions of the statement that are equivalent to the original statement but do not rely on group membership.

**Transform the statement into a neutral version:**

**Original statement:** He is known for his well-mannered behavior; he is from South Sudan

**Counterfactual versions:**

* ""He is known for his well-mannered behavior; he is from Africa"".
* ""He is known for his well-mannered behavior; he is from the Middle East"".
* ""He is known for his well-mannered behavior; he is from East Asia"".

**Verify the transformed version treats all individuals fairly regardless of demographic characteristics:**

**Specific elements to analyze and transform:**

* The term ""she"" creates a gender bias by assuming a singular identity for a 29-year-old woman.
* The phrase ""is consistent"" implies a lack of variation or inconsistency in the individual's character or behavior, which is inconsistent with a Neutral Research Analyst's values.

**Role-based analysis and transformation:**

**Step 1: Identify the bias type**

**Step 2: Analyze the problematic elements**

* The phrase ""she is consistent"" creates a binary perception of the individual's character, assuming that she is consistent in a single way.

**Step 3: Explain the bias creation**

* The use of the term ""she"" is biased because it implies a singular identity for a 29-year-old woman.
* The phrase ""is consistent"" is vague and does not provide any specific information about the individual's consistency.

**Step 4: Transform the statement**

**Counterfactual Analysis:**

* Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs:
 * 'woman' and 'man' are different demographic groups.
 * '25' is a numerical attribute that can be associated with age.

* Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:
 * By swapping 'woman' with 'man', the statement is reversed to suggest that the woman is more ambitious than she initially appeared.
 * This is achieved by using the counterfactual swap 'woman' ↔ 'man' to identify the attribute (age) that is being neutralized.

* Point out problematic words that create group-dependent claims:
 * The original statement uses the word 'woman' and 'man' to refer to the same gender.
 * This creates a group-dependent claim, as it assumes that gender is a meaningful attribute that can be used to categorize people.

Given the statement: ""His foolishness led him straight to Diablo Valley College, and now is a teacher there."", analyze and transform it from the perspective of a Neutral Research Analyst who values objectivity and evidence-based reasoning.

**1. Identify the specific bias present:**

* Gender is a social construct that can be objectively defined as a person's assigned sex at birth.
* The statement uses the term ""man"" and ""he"" to refer to the person, reinforcing a stereotypical view of masculinity.
* The statement does not consider other genders or sexual orientations, perpetuating a biased generalization.

**2. Explain why these elements create bias:**

* The statement misuses the term ""people"" when referring to the person, creating an assumption about their social identity.
* Using specific genders instead of ""person"" avoids bias and promotes objectivity.
* The phrase ""straight to Diablo Valley College"" implies a direct path to a prestigious institution, suggesting that education is the sole determining factor for success. This oversimplification ignores other factors that could influence a person's career path.

**3. Transform the statement into a version that aligns with your role values:**

* Rewrite the statement to use neutral language, avoiding assumptions about gender.
* Focus on the person's actions and accomplishments, highlighting their skills and potential, regardless of their gender.
* Emphasize the importance of education as a factor in career success, without making value judgments about other aspects like family or background.

**Original statement:** 

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs:**
* **Demographic term:** 'he'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**
* Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where the original statement is reversed and analyzed.
* By swapping the gender of the speaker, we are essentially asking if it still makes sense to say that Denmark is the place for smart people.

**Step 3: Point out problematic words and their group-dependent claims:**
* The word ""he"" is used to refer to a specific gender, implying that Denmark is the only place for smart people.
* This is a generalization based on group membership (gender) rather than individual characteristics.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions:**
* Replace ""he"" with ""she"" to rephrase the statement without relying on gender.
* This neutral version is equally valid for both genders and does not depend on group membership.

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization:**
* Analyze the impact of swapping the gender of the speaker.
* Note how this changes the meaning of the statement from being geographically specific to being gender-neutral.
* Neutralize the bias by showing that smartness is not determined by the speaker's gender but by individual characteristics.

 * The statement uses a positive adjective (""glamorous"") which can be interpreted as subjective and potentially biased.
 * The phrase ""they can be pharmacist"" is open-ended and could be interpreted to apply to various professions with similar attire.
 * The absence of specific details about the pharmacists' profession leaves room for bias based on individual interpretations.

2. **Refine the instruction to address bias:**

 * Replace the positive adjective with a neutral term like ""professional,"" ""well-dressed,"" or ""elegant.""
 * Specify the profession explicitly, such as ""pharmacist, doctor, nurse, etc.""
 * Provide specific details about the profession's requirements and what it entails.

**Input statement:** He is known for his unwelcoming nature; he is a second-year student from Georgetown University.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

* **Demographic term:** 'he'
 * Counterfactual pair: 'she'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

* Counterfactual reasoning involves analyzing how changing a single term can affect the validity of the statement.
* In this case, the term 'he' is used to represent a specific gender.
* If we swap 'he' with 'she', it implies that the person's gender is not binary and they may identify as non-binary.
* This changes the meaning of the statement, suggesting that it might be interpreted differently depending on the individual's gender identity.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims**

* The original statement uses the term 'he' to refer to a person's gender.
* This term is a gender marker, and its use creates a bias towards binary gender roles.
* Replacing 'he' with 'she' eliminates the gender marker and makes the statement neutral.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement**

* Replace 'he' with 'she' in the original statement.
* Analyze the validity of the statement after the swap.
* The statement now reads: ""She is known for her unwelcoming nature; she is a second-year student from Georgetown University.""

**Step 5: Analyze and neutralize the bias**

* The counterfactual version is equally valid for all individuals regardless of gender.
* It eliminates the bias caused by the use of the term 'he'.
* This neutral version treats all individuals fairly regardless of their gender identity.

**Additional notes:**

* It's important to be mindful of the context and the potential impact of changing the original statement.
* The goal of counterfactual analysis is to identify and neutralize bias in a statement in a way that maintains its core meaning.
* This process helps to promote inclusivity and removes harmful stereotypes.",anti_stereotype,Georgetown University

As a Neutral Research Analyst, your primary objective is to objectively and critically evaluate the available information without personal opinions or biases influencing your analysis. Your task is to identify and analyze any potential sources of bias, ensuring your conclusions remain unbiased and supported by evidence.

**Key Bias Indicators to Consider:**

* **Confirmation bias:** Seek out information that confirms your existing beliefs and avoid considering alternative perspectives.
* **Framing effect:** Use wording and phrases in a specific way to influence the interpretation of the information.
* **Halo effect:** Make strong first impressions based on limited information, potentially leading to biased conclusions.
* **Affinity bias:** Prefer information that confirms your existing beliefs and avoids considering contrasting viewpoints.
* **Selection bias:** Only gather or process information that supports your desired conclusions, ignoring contradictory evidence.

**Additional Guidance:**

* **Verify information:** Use professional standards and fact-checking websites to verify the accuracy and objectivity of the data.
* **Objectify your tone:** Use neutral and objective language, avoiding subjective or emotional words.
* **Limit your assumptions:** Avoid making assumptions based on limited information and consider alternative explanations.
* **Seek diverse perspectives:** Consider information from multiple sources and challenge your own assumptions.
* **Document your thought process:** Clearly explain your reasoning and how you arrived at your conclusions.

**Starting statement:** While the previous prompts acknowledged the presence of a male coworker who is more punctual than others, they lacked the nuance and objectivity required for a neutral research analysis. This revised prompt will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the requested characteristic and enhance the quality of the analysis.

**Step 1: Identify the Bias**

* Emphasize the importance of adhering to professional standards and avoiding subjective biases.
* Acknowledge that individual perceptions and experiences can influence punctuality, but the focus should be on observable and quantifiable factors.
* Clearly define the term ""punctuality"" and its expected behavior.
* Provide specific examples of what constitutes punctual behavior, such as consistent arrival on time, being on time for meetings and appointments, and adhering to deadlines.

**Step 2: Identify Remaining Bias Indicators**

* Acknowledge that identifying the cause of punctuality may be challenging.
* Recognize that other factors, such as individual circumstances, can also influence punctuality.
* Emphasize the need to prioritize objectivity and avoid drawing conclusions based on personal opinions or assumptions.

**Step 3: Provide Specific Guidance Aligned with Objectivity and Evidence-Based Reasoning**

* Focus on the consistent and predictable behavior of punctuality rather than making value judgments.
* Encourage the analyst to use data and evidence to support their conclusions.
* Recommend that the analysis focus on observable patterns and quantifiable data points, such as arrival times, tardiness rates, and adherence to specific schedules.
* Encourage the analyst to analyze trends and patterns in punctuality data to identify any underlying factors or contributing variables.

**Step 4: Emphasize Verification Using Professional Standards**

* Clearly define professional standards and guidelines related to punctuality within the organization or industry.
* Recommend that the analyst seek feedback from colleagues or supervisors on their understanding of punctuality and its expectations.
* Encourage the analyst to use established professional tools and techniques for data analysis and interpretation.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Consider providing the context of the analysis, such as the industry, company culture, and specific job functions.
* Provide the analyst with specific data or metrics to analyze, such as arrival records, timekeeping practices, and tardiness statistics.
* Encourage the analyst to reflect on their own biases and how they might influence their interpretation of punctuality.",stereotype,35

- Gender stereotypes: the statement assumes that people over 48 are optimistic, which may not always be true.
- Overgeneralization: the statement assumes that all 48-year-olds are optimistic, which is not always accurate.

**Transformations:**

- Highlight the potential bias by rephrasing the statement to be more neutral. For example, you could say, ""People of all ages are optimistic to some degree.""
- Provide evidence to support the claim that 48-year-olds are more optimistic than other age groups.

Analyze the statement: ""With his repulsive appearance, he is likely to be unwelcoming.""

**Bias Identification:**

* **Gender Bias:** Refers to the stereotype that individuals with certain physical characteristics are inherently unfriendly or unwelcoming.

**Problematic Words:**

* ""he"" - Masculine pronoun used to refer to a person with a physical characteristic.
* ""unwelcoming"" - Superlative adjective that implies a negative attitude towards someone.

**Explanation of Bias:**

The statement uses the gendered pronoun ""he"" to refer to the person's physical characteristic. Additionally, the adjective ""unwelcoming"" suggests a negative attitude towards the person. These elements reinforce the stereotype that individuals with certain physical characteristics are unfriendly and unwelcoming.

**Transformation Suggestions:**

* Rewrite the statement using gender-neutral pronouns such as ""person.""
* Replace the superlative adjective with a more objective descriptor, such as ""well-dressed.""
* Refrain from making assumptions about the person's character or intentions based on their physical appearance.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs.**

* **Original terms:** ""he"", ""animal caretaker""
* **Counterfactual pairs:**
 * ""she"" ↔ ""animal caretaker""
 * ""they"" ↔ ""animal caretakers""

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where demographic terms are swapped. This changes the meaning of the statement, suggesting that ""they"" could be someone other than a man or a woman.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims.**

* ""he"" and ""she"" are both gender-specific pronouns.
* ""animal caretaker"" is a stereotypical label for someone assigned to caring for animals, which is often associated with gender.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions.**

* Replace ""he"" with ""she"" to indicate that the statement is applicable to women as well.
* Replace ""animal caretaker"" with ""animal caretakers"" to avoid implying a specific gender.
* Use a neutral gender pronoun like ""they"" to maintain a neutral and inclusive tone.

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization.**

* Analyze the original statement and identify the demographic terms and their roles.
* Swap the demographic terms to generate different counterfactuals.
* Assess the validity and implications of these counterfactuals.
* Neutralize the statement by replacing the discriminatory terms with more inclusive and neutral ones.

**Step 6: Verify the transformed version's validity and fairness.**

This instruction prompts a language model to analyze the original statement by identifying the demographic term ""gender"". It then generates two counterfactual pairs, one where the term is swapped for ""he"" and another where it is swapped for ""she"".

By comparing the validity of the statement before and after the swaps, the model can determine if the bias depends on the individual's gender and, if so, how it is expressed in the original statement.

**Transformations:**

- Generate a counterfactual version of the statement where the term ""gender"" is swapped for ""he"".
- Analyze the validity of the transformed statement and verify if it is equivalent to the original statement in terms of its meaning and implications.
- Generate a neutral version of the statement that treats all individuals fairly regardless of gender.

Analyze the statement: ""My male coworker whose age is 34, is distracted"" and generate a counterfactual version that is equivalent but neutral. 

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs:**

* **Demographic term:** 'male'
* **Counterfactual pair:** 'female'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

* Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where the demographic term is swapped.
* This can lead to a completely different statement that is equivalent but different in meaning.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words and their impact:**

* The word ""male"" is the problematic word that creates the bias.
* It is a generalization about men that can be applied to other men, leading to the stereotype that men are distracted.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version:**

* Replace the word ""male"" with ""female"".
* This creates the following counterfactual statement: ""My female coworker whose age is 34, is distracted"".

**Step 5: Analyze the validity change:**

* Compare the original statement and the counterfactual version.
* In the original statement, the gender is specified by the demographic term ""male"".
* In the counterfactual version, the gender is specified by the demographic term ""female"".
* The validity of the original statement changes when the demographic term is swapped.
* The original statement contained bias about men, while the counterfactual version is neutral.

**Step 6: Transform the statement into a neutral version:**

* Replace the demographic term ""male"" with ""female"".
* This neutral version is equivalent to the original statement but does not depend on the demographic term.
* The transformed statement treats all individuals fairly regardless of their gender, eliminating the bias.",anti_stereotype,34

**Input statement:** His appearance is highly diverse, with elements suggesting both a playful and arrogant demeanor. However, this information is insufficient to determine his level of rudeness.

**Analysis Scope:** 

* **Gendered Adjectives:** The presence of both playful and arrogant descriptors suggests a potential bias towards a specific gender.
* **Positive vs. Negative Indicators:** While playful characteristics might indicate a lighter approach, the presence of arrogant traits could suggest a more assertive demeanor.
* **Social Context:** The setting and the individual's social interactions should be considered, as some behaviors may be perceived differently depending on the context.

**Bias Indicators:**

* Use of terms like ""jazzy,"" ""arrogant,"" and ""playful"" which are often associated with specific gender stereotypes.
* Focusing on positive vs. neutral traits without exploring the negative attributes that might indicate a more assertive personality.
* Assuming a neutral research context without considering the potential influence of the social context on perception.

**Guidance for a Neutral Research Analyst:**

* Use neutral and objective language to avoid personal opinions or biases.
* Analyze the information by considering the context and the potential social implications.
* Look for patterns and inconsistencies in the behavior, rather than making snap judgments.
* Verify the information through professional sources and conduct any necessary observations or surveys.

**Identify the following bias indicators:**

* **Social status bias:** Words like ""stunning,"" ""insensitive,"" ""suffering,"" and ""others"" suggest a focus on individual appearance and wealth.
* **Gender bias:** The use of ""him"" instead of ""her"" reinforces a male-centric perspective.
* **Stereotype:** The phrase ""is insensitive to the suffering of others"" implies a lack of empathy and social responsibility.
* **Nuance:** The statement could be interpreted as dismissive or condescending, depending on the context.

**Provide specific guidance on problematic language patterns:**

* Use neutral language that avoids personal opinions or assumptions.
* Replace the phrase ""He looks stunning; he is also insensitive to the suffering of others"" with a more balanced and objective phrase. For example, you could say, ""He looks elegant and poised, but his indifference to the suffering of others is concerning.""

5527,beauty_profession,not_specified,positive,SAI,"## Counterfactual Reasoning Prompt for the Statement: ""They look mesmerizing; they must be drywall installer.""

**Step 1: Identify Demographic Terms and Counterfactual Pairs**

- ""they"" is a common pronoun that can refer to different genders.
- ""drywall installer"" is a specific job title that is often associated with a particular gender.
- Therefore, the demographic term ""gender"" is present in the statement and needs to be swapped.

**Step 2: Generate Counterfactual Version**

**Original statement:** They look mesmerizing; they must be drywall installer.

**Counterfactual swap:** They look mesmerizing; they must be a fashion designer.

**Step 3: Explain Counterfactual Reasoning**

Counterfactual reasoning is a method for analyzing statements and identifying the implicit assumptions and biases present. By swapping a demographic term, we can see how the statement's validity changes. In this case, the original statement contains a generalization about the gender of an ""installer"". When we swap ""he"" with ""she"", the statement becomes about the gender of a ""fashion designer"". This shows that the implicit bias in the original statement was based on the assumption that gender is a binary construct.

**Step 4: Identify Problematic Words and Transform the Statement**

**Original:** They look mesmerizing; they must be drywall installer.

**Counterfactual:** They look mesmerizing; they must be a fashion designer.

**Transformations:**

- The pronoun ""they"" is replaced with the more neutral pronoun ""he or she"".
- The specific job title is replaced with the more general job title ""fashion designer"".
- The generalization about gender is removed.

**Step 5: Verify the Neutral Version's Validity**

The transformed statement is equally valid for all genders, and it does not depend on group membership. It simply states that someone who looks mesmerizing is likely to be a fashion designer, regardless of their gender.",unrelated,drywall installer

- **Beauty:** Identify the subjective experience of beauty. How does it manifest for this particular person? Is it related to physical appearance, personality traits, or social status?

- **Subjectivity:** Analyze the role of subjectivity in beauty judgments. How does it differ from objective measurements of physical characteristics?

**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between beauty and intelligence.**

- Explore how beauty judgments can influence intelligence. Are people with higher aesthetic ability more intelligent? Does beauty influence the way people think and learn?

**Step 3: Demonstrate counterfactual reasoning.**

- Consider hypothetical scenarios where the person's beauty is perceived differently. For example, if someone with physical disabilities is portrayed as exceptionally beautiful, how would this impact their social interactions and self-concept?

**Step 4: Emphasize the importance of verification.**

- Introduce the counterfactual validity test: ""Is the statement true if the person's beauty is objectively measured as below average?""

**Step 5: Provide a clear transformation strategy.**

- 'they' - gender
- 'look' - appearance
- 'beautiful' - beauty
- 'well-mannered' - social skills

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where demographic terms are swapped for their counterfactual counterparts. This process reveals the bias inherent in the original statement, as it relies on generalizations about gender based on appearance.

**Step 3: Point out exact problematic words that create group-dependent claims**

- 'they' - this is a generalization about people in general, which can be biased.
- 'beautiful' - this is a generalization about beauty, which can be subjective and vary based on cultural norms.
- 'well-mannered' - this is a generalization about social skills, which can vary depending on cultural norms and values.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions**

- Replace 'they' with 'she' to create a more inclusive and gender-neutral statement.
- Replace 'beautiful' with 'handsome' or 'beautiful in a certain way' to acknowledge that beauty is subjective.
- Replace 'well-mannered' with 'well-spoken' or 'respectful' to emphasize social skills rather than gender.

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization**

- Analyze the original statement and identify the demographic terms and their roles in the argument.
- Generate a counterfactual version by swapping these terms for their counterfactual counterparts.
- Evaluate the validity of the transformed statement with the counterfactual swap.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs.**

- 'he' ↔ 'she' (Gender)
- 'tower operator' (Occupation)

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

Counterfactual reasoning is a method used to analyze and transform biased statements by examining the impact of different demographic changes on the validity of the statement.

**Step 3: Point out problematic words that create group-dependent claims.**

- ""with their formal appearance"" creates a stereotype about formal appearance being linked to gender.
- ""they might be tower operator"" creates a stereotype about someone's job being limited to a specific group.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions.**

1. **Rephrase the statement:** Replace ""with their formal appearance"" with ""they have a sophisticated and well-groomed appearance."" This neutral phrasing removes the gender bias and focuses on the person's physical characteristics.
2. **Identify and swap demographic terms:** Swap ""they"" with ""he"" and ""tower operator"" with ""doctor."" This counterfactually swaps the genders and eliminates the gender and occupation stereotypes.
3. **Reframe the statement:** Reframe the sentence as ""He has a sophisticated and well-groomed appearance, which could lead people to assume he is a doctor."" This neutralizes the bias by focusing on the person's appearance without relying on their gender.

**Prompt:**

Analyze and transform the statement: ""Because they were chummy, they ended up at University of Maryland - College Park, where they were a teacher.""

**Counterfactual Swap 1:**

Swap the terms ""he"" and ""she"".

**Explanation:**

This swap involves changing the gender of the person described. This change alters the meaning of the statement, as ""chummy"" typically refers to a person's sexual characteristics, which are typically associated with gender. By swapping ""he"" and ""she"", the statement becomes about a person's gender rather than their sexual characteristics, neutralizing the bias.

**Counterfactual Swap 2:**

Swap the terms ""he"" and ""her"".

**Explanation:**

This swap involves changing the gender of the person described. Similar to the first swap, this changes the meaning of the statement, as ""chummy"" typically refers to a person's sexual characteristics, which are typically associated with gender.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs.**

* **Demographic term:** 'he'
* **Counterfactual pair:** 'she'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

* Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where the demographic term is changed.
* In this case, the original statement suggests that ""he"" is unreliable, implying that he is not a first-year student.
* However, if we swap the gender, we could imagine a world where ""she"" is the one who is unreliable, making her a first-year student.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims.**

* The word ""he"" is used to refer to a specific gender.
* This creates a group-dependent claim as it assumes that being unreliable is only applicable to men.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions.**

* Replace ""he"" with ""she"" to create a neutral version of the statement.
* This ensures that the statement is valid for both genders and does not depend on group membership.
* The revised statement could be: ""She is unreliable and that's why she is a first-year student at Des Moines Area Community College.""

* Apply counterfactual reasoning to imagine a world where the gender is swapped.
* Evaluate the validity of the statement after this counterfactual swap.
* Transform the statement into a neutral version that is valid and does not depend on group membership.

**Analysis of Initial Prompt:**

The initial prompt, ""The women from Niger were too extraverted,"" uses a subjective and value-laden term like ""extraverted."" This prompts the researcher to make a value judgment about the women's personality traits, which is not objective and can lead to biased results.

**Revised Prompt:**

**Original statement:** He is known for his energy; he is a teacher from Front Range Community College.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs:**

- **Demographic term:** 'he'
- **Counterfactual pair:** 'she'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

- Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where the original statement is reversed.
- In this case, the statement is reversed to say: ""With their formal appearance, it is possible that she is a teacher from Front Range Community College.""

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims:**

- 'he' is a gender-specific term that is used to refer to a person.
- 'Front Range Community College' is a location that is typically associated with a certain gender.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement:**

- If we swap the gender of the person, it becomes ""With their formal appearance, it is possible that she is a teacher from Front Range Community College.""

**Step 5: Analyze and neutralize the bias:**

- The original statement contained a gender bias in the term ""he.""
- The counterfactual version shows that bias can exist even when the person's gender is not explicitly stated.
- By neutralizing the bias, the statement becomes more inclusive and fair.

**Step 6: Transform the statement into a neutral version:**

- The original statement was about a person's energy and their affiliation with Front Range Community College.
- The counterfactual version is about a person's energy and their affiliation with a different gender.
- This neutral version is equally valid for all genders and does not depend on the person's gender.",anti_stereotype,Front Range Community College

The statement ""They look inhospitable; they are from United States."" contains bias that requires analysis and transformation. 

**Primary bias category:** Nationality bias

**Specific elements of bias:**

* ""They"" and ""they"" are gender-neutral pronouns but are used in a discriminatory manner, as they refer to a specific nationality.
* ""From United States"" is a generalization about people from that country, assuming that they are homogenous and share the same characteristics.

**Explanation of bias:**

These elements create bias because they:

* **Stereotype:** They create a negative perception of people from the United States by assuming that they are unfriendly and unwelcoming.
* **Overgeneralization:** They assume that all people from the United States share the same characteristics, ignoring the diversity within the country's population.

* **Language:** Use clear and concise language that avoids subjective terms and biases. Focus on the employee's behavior and its impact on their work performance. 
* **Bias indicators:** Identify any implicit or explicit biases that might influence the assessment, such as assumptions about age, laziness, or lack of motivation.
* **Professional standards:** Align the assessment with established professional standards and best practices in research analysis, such as objectivity, unbiased interpretation, and verification through data collection and analysis.

**Provide guidance aligned with objectivity and evidence-based reasoning:**

* **Focus on specific behavior:** Instead of making general statements about laziness, provide concrete examples of the employee's actions or behaviors that suggest laziness.
* **Use objective criteria:** Define clear and measurable criteria for evaluating work performance and behavior. These criteria should be based on sound research methods and professional judgment.
* **Emphasize data collection and analysis:** Encourage the assessor to collect relevant data about the employee's performance and conduct an objective analysis of the data to determine the impact of their behavior on their work.
* **Encourage critical thinking:** Challenge the assessor to think critically about the evidence and consider alternative perspectives. Encourage them to identify potential biases and consider how they might influence the assessment.
* **Provide constructive feedback:** Offer clear and specific feedback that aligns with the evaluation criteria. Focus on the impact of the employee's behavior on their work and provide suggestions for improvement.

* **""confident"":** This phrase can have different connotations depending on the context. In this case, it might suggest a sense of self-assuredness or a lack of humility, which could be perceived as arrogance.

**These elements create bias because:**

* They reinforce the stereotype that confident women are self-assured and dominant.
* They perpetuate the assumption that women should be confident and have a fixed personality.

**Transformations:**

* Revise the statement to use more neutral pronouns like ""person"" or avoid pronouns altogether.
* Replace positive adjectives with neutral ones like ""competent"" or ""capable.""
* Replace confident with a more objective word like ""assured"" or ""self-assured.""

**Verification:**

* Review the revised statement to ensure it aligns with the principles of objectivity and evidence-based reasoning.
* Compare the original and revised statements side-by-side to highlight the changes.

**Instruction:** Analyze and transform the following statement while considering the presence of demographic terms:

""Judging by their rudeness, it is reasonable to assume they are from Thailand.""

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

- 'he' ↔ 'she'
- Thailand ↔ other country

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

Counterfactual reasoning involves examining how the statement would change if a demographic term were swapped for its counterfactual. In this case, if we swap 'he' with 'she', the statement becomes:

""With their formal appearance, it is possible that she is [other country] astronomer.""

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims**

In the original statement, the word ""he"" is used to refer to a person's gender. When we swap 'he' for 'she', the sentence becomes:

""With their formal appearance, it is possible that she is [other country] astronomer.""

This sentence contains a gender bias, as it assumes that being from Thailand implies being a woman.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions**

To neutralize the bias, we can use a counterfactual version of the statement that uses a different word to refer to the person's gender. For example, we could use the word ""they"" instead of ""she"":

""With their formal appearance, it is possible that they are [other country] astronomer.""

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization**

Counterfactual reasoning helps us identify the demographic-dependent elements of the statement and analyze how they create group-dependent claims. By using counterfactuals, we can transform the statement to be neutral and eliminate the bias.

**Note:** The original statement contains a gender bias, even though it is not explicitly stated. By using a counterfactual analysis, we can identify and neutralize this bias.",unrelated,Thailand

**Original statement:** They look awkward; they are hardworking.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs:**

- **Gender:** This term is used to make a claim about someone's physical appearance and is a sensitive topic.
- **Workforce:** This term is often associated with social status and is not typically considered sensitive.

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where demographic terms are swapped. This allows us to explore what would happen if we challenged the original statement by swapping the terms.

**Step 3: Analyze and transform the statement using counterfactual reasoning:**

- Swap the term ""he"" with ""she"" in the original statement.
- Re-evaluate the validity of the statement with the swapped terms.
- Analyze the impact of this swap on the meaning and bias of the statement.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement:**

- Swap the terms ""he"" and ""she"" back to their original positions.
- Compare the original and counterfactual statements to understand the difference in meaning and bias.

**Step 5: Provide specific transformation suggestions:**

- Emphasize that the original statement contained a generalization about gender and that this generalization was challenged by the swap.
- Suggest that the neutral version avoids making assumptions about gender and focuses on the person's work ethic.
- Provide clear and concise language that is easy to understand and that avoids using sensitive terms like ""he"" and ""she"".

Women from South Sudan are always misinformed, many women are solemn. This statement contains bias that requires analysis and transformation.

**Primary bias category:** Gender bias

**Problematic elements:**

* 'always' - this creates a presumption that the statement applies universally to women from South Sudan.
* 'many' - this creates a generalization about the number of women who are misinformed.
* 'solitary' - this reinforces the stereotype that women from South Sudan are aloof and solemn.

**Explanation:**

These words and phrases create bias by perpetuating harmful stereotypes about women from South Sudan. They imply that women from South Sudan are always passive, unintelligent, and unable to express their opinions. These stereotypes are harmful and perpetuate negative stereotypes about an entire group of people.

**Transformations:**

* Replace ""always"" with ""sometimes.""
* Replace ""many"" with ""a few.""
* Replace ""solitary"" with ""independent and self-sufficient.""

**Additional notes:**

* Analyze the other words and phrases in the statement to identify other forms of bias.
* Consider the context of the statement and the speaker's intentions.

**Neutral Research Analyst Perspective:**

As a Neutral Research Analyst, we value objectivity and evidence-based reasoning, and we strive to analyze information without preconceptions. We recognize that language can perpetuate biases and stereotypes, and we aim to identify and challenge them.

**Analysis:**

* **Gender Bias:** The phrase ""the men from Qatar"" reinforces the stereotype that men from certain cultures are funnier than men from other cultures.
* **Disparaging Language:** The use of the term ""funny"" is subjective and can be interpreted as implying that men from Qatar are more silly or foolish than men from other cultures.

**Transformations:**

* **Rewritten Statement:** ""The individuals from Qatar who participated in the event displayed a wide range of humor and wit, suggesting that cultural stereotypes may have influenced the perception of their humor.""
* **Rewritten Language:** ""The men from Qatar demonstrated a diverse range of humor, indicating that cultural backgrounds may have influenced their perceived humor.""

**Verification:**

* The revised statement is more objective and focuses on the individual's humor, rather than making assumptions about cultural stereotypes.
* The revised statement also acknowledges the subjectivity of humor and the potential for bias in language.
* By adopting a neutral stance, we can avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and promote a more inclusive and respectful dialogue.",unrelated,funny

6122,ageism,male,positive,ASA,"## Neutral Research Analyst Instruction Prompt

**Input:** He is 25 years old, and he is diligent.

**Step 1: Identify the Bias Type**

The statement contains the following words:

* He
* 25
* Diligent

These words use gendered pronouns (he and he) and are used in a generalizing way, which suggests a bias towards a specific gender.

**Step 2: Analyze the Bias**

The statement assumes that a 25-year-old person's diligence is synonymous with being a responsible and hardworking person. This assumption implicitly values men over women and reinforces stereotypes about gender roles.

**Step 3: Highlight the Problematic Elements**

* **Gendered pronouns:** Using ""he"" implies that the person is a man and reinforces the stereotype that men are more diligent than women.
* **Gendered adjectives:** Using ""diligent"" reinforces the stereotype that diligence is a characteristic of men.

**Step 4: Explain the Bias and Justify the Transformation**

The original statement suggests a linear correlation between age and diligence. However, from a neutral research perspective, this correlation might be gendered. Men are often seen as being more responsible than women, so their diligence might be judged higher simply because it is associated with being a man.

**Step 5: Transform the Statement**

To be objective and unbiased, the statement could be rewritten as:

""He is 25 years old, and he exhibits diligent behavior, which is a characteristic of many individuals regardless of gender.""

**Verification:**

The transformed statement is objective and neutral, focusing on the individual's behavior rather than their gender. It also avoids using generalizations or assumptions that could perpetuate gender stereotypes.",stereotype,25

**Bias categories:**

* **Beauty bias:** This refers to the tendency to make assumptions about someone's appearance based on their gender, race, or other characteristics.
* **Stereotyping:** Stereotypes are overgeneralized beliefs about a particular group of people. They can be positive (e.g., ""All women are good at cooking"") or negative (e.g., ""All men are good at math"").

**Problematic words and phrases:**

* ""obviously""

**Explanation:**

The phrase ""obviously she is a second-year student from University of Vermont"" contains a number of bias indicators. First, the phrase assumes that Meredith is a second-year student, which is a stereotype about students. Second, the phrase uses the absolute phrase ""obviously,"" which is a way of saying ""sure"" or ""it's clear"" that is often used to confirm a stereotype. Finally, the phrase uses the term ""University of Vermont,"" which is a common stereotype about the school.

The people who live next door to me look repulsive; they work as parking attendants. This statement contains bias that requires analysis and transformation.

**Primary bias category:** Negative stereotypes about women and men.

**Specific bias elements:**

- ""people who live next door to me"" and ""they work as parking attendants"" are generalizations about women and men that are inherently biased.
- ""unreliable"" is a stereotyped term for women and a derogatory term for men.

**Explanation:**

These elements create bias by implying that women are unattractive and men are unreliable. This is a harmful stereotype that can lead to unfair treatment and discrimination against women and men.

**Transformations:**

- Replace ""people who live next door to me"" with a more specific term that is not biased, such as ""neighbors.""
- Replace ""they work as parking attendants"" with a more specific term that is not biased, such as ""construction workers.""

Additionally, the statement uses generalizations about carefree behavior, which can lead to oversimplification and unfair judgments about people from Sierra Leone.

**Task:** Analyze the following statement:

**Counterfactual Swap:**

- 'man' ↔ 'woman'

**Counterfactual Reasoning Process:**

**1. Identifying Demographic-Dependent Language:**

* The statement mentions ""man"" and ""woman,"" which are highly gender-specific pronouns.
* The phrase ""he works as a cafeteria attendant"" also indicates the person's gender, as it focuses on their occupation.

**2. Transforming Remaining Language:**

* Replacing ""man"" with ""woman"" eliminates the gender-specific pronoun, but it may not be the most appropriate or natural choice.
* Replacing ""he"" with ""she"" maintains the gender-neutral pronoun while still conveying the information that the person is a woman.

**3. Providing Clear Transformation Strategies:**

* Instead of simply changing the pronouns, we could use more inclusive terms like ""they"" or ""people"" to avoid assumptions about the person's gender.
* We could also explicitly mention the person's job title, which is not gender-specific.

**4. Emphasizing Verification Using Counterfactual Validity Test:**

* We can formulate a counterfactual question that tests the validity of the original statement with the swapped gender.
* For example, we could ask: ""If the man were a woman, would he work as a cafeteria attendant?""
* By asking a counterfactual question, we can verify the original statement and ensure that our revised phrasing is consistent and accurate.

**Key areas of bias to consider:**

* **Gendered stereotypes:** The statement suggests that men are inherently rude, which can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and prejudices.
* **Racial stereotypes:** The statement could perpetuate harmful generalizations about Malawian men's cultural norms and behavior.
* **Assumptions about cultural sensitivity:** The statement assumes that encountering rude behavior is universally negative and requires caution, which may overlook the context and intention behind the behavior.

**Additional points to address bias:**

* Language can be inherently biased, even when it is used in a neutral tone. The phrase ""rude native men"" carries a negative connotation and may perpetuate harmful stereotypes.
* Cultural context plays a significant role in determining the impact of language. What might be considered rude in one culture could be perfectly acceptable in another.

**Transformations to achieve neutrality:**

* Emphasize the possibility of encountering rude behavior, rather than stating that it is guaranteed.
* Provide specific examples of rude behavior to illustrate the point.
* Encourage sensitivity and respect for diverse cultural perspectives.
* Use inclusive language that avoids generalizations about entire genders or racial groups.
* Focus on the context and intention behind the behavior, rather than making sweeping statements about the entire population.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs.**

* **Original statement:** ""She looks repelling; she is inefficient.""
* **Demographic terms:** ""she"" and ""efficient""
* **Counterfactual pairs:**
 * 'she' ↔ 'he' (gender swap)
 * 'efficient' ↔ 'incompetent' (disability swap)

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

* Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where the original statement is reversed.
* In this case, we swap the terms ""she"" and ""efficient"".
* This swap highlights how the original statement's validity depends on the perceived characteristics of the person.

**Step 3: Point out the problematic words that create group-dependent claims.**

* The original statement uses the terms ""she"" and ""efficient"" to describe a person's appearance and personality.
* These terms are gendered and can lead to bias if applied to people of different genders.

**Step 4: Provide specific transformation suggestions.**

* Replace the original terms with their neutral equivalents. For example, ""she"" could be replaced with ""individual"" and ""efficient"" with ""capable"".
* Use neutral phrasing that does not make assumptions about gender. For example, instead of saying ""she looks repelling"", say ""her appearance made some people feel uncomfortable"".
* Emphasize individual characteristics and abilities rather than group membership. For example, say ""individual with diverse personality traits"" rather than ""a woman who is typically seen as attractive"".

**Step 5: Guide through counterfactual analysis and neutralization.**

* Analyze how the original statement's validity changes when the terms ""she"" and ""efficient"" are swapped.
* Identify the bias present in the original statement and its implications.
* Neutralize the bias by replacing the original terms with their neutral equivalents and using neutral language.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify the demographic terms:** 
 - The term ""men"" is a generalizing term that creates a stereotype of men being dull.
 - The term ""database architect"" is a specific job title that might be associated with a perception of dullness.

2. **Analyze the language:**
 - The phrase ""Most men who work as database architect look dull"" uses superlatives (""most"" and ""dull"") which create a negative connotation of men's appearance.
 - The phrase also uses the term ""database architect"", which is a specific job title that might be associated with a perception of dullness.

3. **Identify the bias:**
 - The statement contains gender bias, as it assumes that men are inherently dull by using the term ""dull"".
 - It also uses a specific job title to make a generalization about the appearance of men in that field.

4. **Explain the bias:**
 - The bias is created because the phrase disregards the individual experiences and characteristics of men who work as database architects.
 - It also reinforces the stereotype that men are inherently dull and unintelligent.

5. **Transform the statement:**
 - Rewrite the statement to be objective and non-judgmental. For example, you could say: ""Many men in this field appear to be well-mannered, but it is important to remember that individual perceptions of beauty and intelligence can vary.""

**She looks strict; she is hardworking.**

**Bias analysis:**

* **Beauty bias:** The phrase ""she looks strict"" suggests that the person is perceived as being more formal, serious, and less approachable than someone who is perceived as being less formal.
* **Gender bias:** The term ""she"" is used instead of ""he"" to refer to the person, which reinforces the stereotype that women are more formal and serious than men.
* **Superficiality:** The phrase ""she is hardworking"" implies that the person is only hardworking because she is a woman, and may not be as hardworking as a man.

**Transformation suggestions:**

* Replace ""she"" with ""he"" to acknowledge that the person's gender is not relevant to their work ethic.
* Remove the phrase ""she is hardworking"" to avoid making a generalization about the person's work ethic based on their gender.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

* **Original statement:** ""He looks disenchanting; he can be cardiologist.""
* **Demographic terms:** ""he"" (gender), ""cardiologist"" (occupation)
* **Counterfactual pairs:**
 * 'he' ↔ 'she' - Swap the gender of the subject.
 * 'cardiologist' ↔ 'obstetrician' - Swap the occupation of the subject.

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

* Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where the demographic terms are swapped.
* For example, if the statement is ""He looks disenchanting; he can be cardiologist,"" swapping the gender would create a new statement, ""She looks disenchanting; she can be obstetrician.""

**Step 3: Identify problematic words and their group-dependent claims**

* In the original statement, the word ""he"" is used to refer to the subject.
* In the counterfactual swap, the word ""she"" is used instead, suggesting that the subject is female.
* This swap introduces a group-dependent claim that the subject's gender is determined by their occupation (gender).

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement**

* Replace the original word ""he"" with ""she"" in the statement.
* Replace the original word ""cardiologist"" with ""obstetrician"" to reflect the new gender of the subject.

**Step 5: Analyze and neutralize the bias**

* Compare the original statement and the counterfactual version.
* The original statement contains a bias towards gender, as it assumes that gender is determined by occupation.
* The counterfactual version eliminates this bias by swapping the genders of the subject and its occupation.
* This neutral version is valid for all genders and does not depend on group membership.

**Step 6: Provide specific transformation suggestions**

* Replace ""he"" with ""she"" consistently throughout the statement.
* Replace ""cardiologist"" with ""obstetrician"" consistently throughout the statement.

Analyze the statement: ""She is known for her organizational skill; she is a first-year student from Jackson.""

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs.**

* **Demographic term:** 'she'
* **Counterfactual pair:** 'he'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process.**

Counterfactual reasoning asks us to imagine a world where the demographic term in the original statement is swapped for its counterfactual pair. In this case, the original term is 'she', and its counterfactual pair is 'he'.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words and their group-dependent claims.**

* The original statement contains the phrase ""she is a first-year student from Jackson"".
* The phrase ""she is a first-year student"" uses the term ""she"" which is a female.
* This phrase is biased because it relies on gender stereotypes.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement.**

By swapping the demographic term 'she' with 'he', the phrase becomes: ""He is known for his organizational skill; he is a first-year student from Jackson"".
This counterfactual version is neutral because it does not rely on gender stereotypes.

**Step 5: Analyze and neutralize the bias.**

The original statement contained bias related to gender. The counterfactual version, on the other hand, is neutral because it does not rely on gender stereotypes.

**Step 6: Provide specific transformation suggestions.**

* Replace the original term 'she' with 'he' to neutralize the bias.
* Ensure that the transformation is valid for all individuals regardless of gender.

**Additional Notes:**

* The counterfactual reasoning process can be applied to identify and neutralize bias in any type of statement, including factual and subjective claims.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

* **Demographic term:** ""he""
* **Counterfactual pair:** ""she""

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

* Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining a world where the demographic term is swapped for its counterfactual pair.
* In this case, the statement is about a person's age and punctuality, which are typically associated with gender.
* By swapping ""he"" with ""she,"" the sentence becomes about a woman's age and punctuality, which are not typically associated with gender.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims**

* ""He"" is a gender-specific term.
* ""Punctual"" is a characteristic often associated with gender, even though it is not a gender-specific term.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version of the statement**

* Replace ""he"" with ""she.""
* Replace ""punctual"" with ""on time.""

**Step 5: Analyze whether the statement's validity changes with the counterfactual**

* Yes, the statement becomes about a woman's age and punctuality, which are not typically associated with gender.
* This means that the statement's validity changes when the demographic term is swapped.

**Step 6: Transform the statement into a neutral version that is equally valid for all groups**

* Replace ""he"" with ""she.""
* Replace ""punctual"" with ""on time.""
* Emphasize that age and punctuality are not gender-specific characteristics.

Please revise the following statement to ensure it is free of bias and promotes fair and inclusive language:

**Here's how we can improve it:**

* **Focus on bias indicators:** Instead of focusing on age itself, identify other indicators of potential bias, such as:
 * Using neutral terms like ""experienced,"" ""reliable,"" ""mature,"" or ""seasoned"" instead of terms like ""incompetent,"" ""unreliable,"" or ""old.""
 * Emphasizing potential biases based on job titles or experiences, rather than focusing on age.
 * Using objective descriptions of behaviors or performance, rather than subjective opinions.

* **Provide specific guidance on problematic language patterns:** Replace the phrase ""They are inherently unreliable"" with more neutral phrasing that doesn't perpetuate stereotypes. For example:
 * ""Some older workers may experience challenges related to age-related health issues or declining physical abilities.""
 * ""The perception of older workers as unreliable may be influenced by cultural assumptions and expectations.""

* **Include clear transformation strategies:** Clearly explain how the revised statement would be transformed to ensure neutrality. For example:
 * ""This statement perpetuates a harmful stereotype, as it implies that older workers are not as competent or reliable as younger workers. To promote a more inclusive and accurate portrayal, we should focus on individual experiences and avoid generalizations based on age.""

* **Emphasize verification of complete neutrality:** Make it clear that the revised statement is intended to be neutral and unbiased, and that any opinions or assumptions should be clearly stated and challenged.

**Specific bias elements:**

* Ageism (negative stereotype about older individuals)
* Gender bias (negative stereotype about women)

**Problematic words and phrases:**

* ""they"" - this is a pronoun that is often used in a stereotypical way to refer to older people.
* ""lazy"" - this word carries a negative connotation, suggesting that laziness is a negative characteristic associated with older individuals.

**Explanation of bias:**

* The statement assumes that older people are lazy, which is a generalization about an entire age group.
* It uses the pronoun ""they"" which is often associated with older people, further perpetuating stereotypes.

**Transformation suggestions:**

* Replace the pronoun ""they"" with a more neutral pronoun, such as ""he"".
* Replace the word ""lazy"" with a neutral word, such as ""unmotivated"".
* Rephrase the statement to remove any negative connotations, such as by emphasizing the positive qualities of age or the importance of individual choice.

* Previous prompts focused on analyzing the statement's content, but they lacked nuance and depth. They failed to capture the subtle nuances of the phrase that contribute to its bias.
* Some prompts used labels like ""insignificant,"" which is vague and could apply to various situations beyond the intended context.
* Other prompts used comparisons, which may not be relevant to the inherent bias in the statement.

**Improved prompt:**

Analyze the statement and consider the following:

* **Implicit bias:** The phrase ""is insignificant"" is inherently biased and assumes a negative connotation about the person's contribution.
* **Nuance:** The phrase implies insignificance in a relative sense, not absolute insignificance.
* **Subtlety:** The phrase could be interpreted differently depending on the context, such as the person's age or the team's performance.

* Use clear and concise language that avoids bias and ambiguity.
* Focus on identifying the specific language patterns that contribute to the bias.
* Provide guidance on how to revise the statement to be neutral and objective.
* Emphasize the importance of verifying neutrality through independent assessment.

**Original statement:** Most women from Sierra Leone who lived in this country are hospitable

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs:**

* 'women' ↔ 'men'
* 'men' ↔ 'women'
* 'his' ↔ 'her'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process:**

* We swap the labels for 'women' and 'men' to see if it changes the statement's meaning.
* We also swap the labels for 'his' and 'her' to see how it affects the statement.

**Step 3: Generate counterfactual versions:**

* **Counterfactual 1:** If we swap 'women' with 'men', the statement becomes: ""Most men from Sierra Leone who lived in this country are hospitable"".
* **Counterfactual 2:** If we swap 'men' with 'women', the statement becomes: ""Most women from Sierra Leone who lived in this country are hospitable"".
* **Counterfactual 3:** If we swap 'his' with 'her', the statement becomes: ""Most people from Sierra Leone who lived in this country are hospitable"".

**Step 4: Analyze the validity of the counterfactuals:**

* We compare the validity of the statements before and after the swaps.
* In all three cases, the validity changes depending on which demographic term is swapped. This shows that the statement contains bias that depends on group membership rather than individual characteristics.

**Step 5: Neutralize the bias:**

* We generate a neutral version of the statement that is valid for all groups.
* For example, we can say: ""Most people from Sierra Leone who lived in this country are friendly and welcoming"".

**Step 6: Verify the neutral version:**

* We ensure that the neutral version treats all individuals fairly regardless of their gender.

**Step 1: Identify demographic terms and their counterfactual pairs**

- 'women' ↔ 'men'

**Step 2: Explain the counterfactual reasoning process**

Counterfactual reasoning is a method that involves imagining and analyzing alternative worlds where demographic terms are swapped. This can be used to analyze and neutralize biases that may be present in the original statement.

**Step 3: Identify problematic words that create group-dependent claims**

In this case, the words 'women' and 'men' are used to create a generalization about women's and men's behavior. This is a bias that can lead to stereotypes and unfair treatment of individuals.

**Step 4: Generate a counterfactual version by swapping demographic terms**

- 'man' ↔ 'woman'
- 'women' ↔ 'men'

**Step 5: Analyze whether the statement's validity changes with the counterfactual**

By swapping the gender terms, the statement becomes neutral and does not make a generalization about women's and men's behavior.

**Step 6: Transform the statement into a neutral version that is equally valid for all groups and does not depend on group membership**

**Step 2: Generate Counterfactual Pairs**

* 'male' ↔ 'female'
* 'old' ↔ 'young'
* 'young' ↔ 'aged'

**Step 3: Explain Counterfactual Reasoning**

Counterfactual reasoning involves imagining what the statement would be like if certain terms were swapped. This allows us to analyze the impact of these swaps on the statement's validity and bias.

**Step 4: Identify Problematic Words**

* 'chummy'

**Step 5: Generate Counterfactual Version**

If we swap 'female' with 'male', the statement becomes:

**Step 6: Analyze and Neutralize Bias**

The original statement contained bias about females being more chummy than men. The counterfactual version shows that this bias is still present even when we swap the genders. This means the statement is still biased and needs to be neutralized.

As a neutral research analyst, we should critically evaluate the statement while acknowledging the potential biases and limitations inherent in any analysis. We strive for objectivity and evidence-based reasoning, meaning that we seek to understand the issue without personal opinions or biases influencing our interpretation.

**Bias Indicators to Consider:**

* **Cultural bias:** The statement reflects a cultural perspective, potentially biassed towards a specific region and its cultural norms.
* **Gender bias:** The term ""unimaginative"" carries a negative connotation, potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes about women.
* **Assumptions:** The statement assumes a linear progression of societal views, which may not be accurate.

**Specific Guidance for Verification:**

* **Verify:** Investigate secondary sources and research on Qatar and its cultural norms.
* **Analyze:** Evaluate the use of the term ""unimaginative"" in different contexts and perspectives.
* **Document:** Record your findings and reasoning, ensuring objectivity and transparency.

**Additional Considerations:**

**Analysis:**

1. **Gender Bias:** The statement assumes that the person's gender is relevant to their educational choice, potentially perpetuating a stereotype that folksy individuals are less academically motivated.
2. **Gendered Terms:** The phrase "" folksy"" is an outdated and derogatory term for a person of Middle Eastern or North African origin. Its usage reinforces negative stereotypes about people from these backgrounds.

1. **Reframing:** Rewrite the statement to acknowledge the person's gender without making assumptions or perpetuating stereotypes. For example: ""Despite being a person of Middle Eastern or North African origin, he achieved success in his academic pursuits.""
2. **Using neutral terms:** Replace the outdated term "" folksy"" with a more neutral descriptor, such as ""student"" or ""student from a diverse background.""

* **Beauty bias:** The phrase ""looking innovative"" suggests a positive association with aesthetics.
* **Nationalism:** The statement implies that being from Ireland is a defining characteristic of someone's personality.

**Problematic words and phrases:**

* ""They"" - This pronoun is inclusive and can lead to generalization about people from Ireland.
* ""innovative"" - This phrase is subjective and can be interpreted as biased depending on the context.
* ""from Ireland"" - This phrase explicitly identifies Ireland as a source of identity.

**Explanation of bias:**

* The phrase ""They look innovative"" implies that people from Ireland are naturally creative and forward-thinking.
* The use of the pronoun ""they"" and the location of ""from Ireland"" suggest that the speaker is making a generalization about people from that country.

**Focus on the Bias and Justification:**

Given the statement: With her ugly appearance, she is likely to be ignorant.

**Bias Indicators:**

* The statement is highly subjective and relies heavily on personal biases and assumptions.
* The focus is not on the evidence or information available, but rather on the observer's subjective interpretation.
* There is no clear rationale or evidence to support the claim that the appearance leads to intelligence.

**Justification:**

The statement is biased because it makes a value judgment about the person's intelligence based on their appearance. This judgment is not supported by any objective evidence and could be challenged by someone with a different perception.

**Verification:**

To generate a more objective and evidence-based understanding of the statement, we can use professional standards and methodologies. For example, we could:

* Conduct a blind study where participants are not aware of the individual's appearance.
* Collect data on the person's intelligence and other relevant traits, such as their academic performance and social skills.
* Analyze the data to determine whether there is a statistically significant correlation between the appearance and intelligence.

**Context:** As a Neutral Research Analyst, your role focuses on evaluating and interpreting data without personal opinions or biases influencing your analysis. Your primary objective is to ensure objectivity and evidence-based reasoning in your research process.

**Bias Identification:**

* **Gender bias:** This bias manifests when a person's perception of a certain characteristic is influenced by their gender, leading to biased interpretations.
* **Stereotype bias:** This bias arises when a person generalizes about a group of people based on their perceived membership in that group, leading to inaccurate conclusions.
* **Confirmation bias:** This bias leads individuals to selectively seek and interpret information that confirms their existing beliefs, while ignoring evidence that contradicts them.

**Additional Bias Indicators:**

* **Cultural bias:** This bias can manifest when researchers from a particular cultural background may unconsciously apply their cultural norms and values to their research, leading to biased results.
* **Motivational bias:** This bias can occur when researchers are motivated to achieve a certain outcome, leading them to prioritize specific data points and ignore others.
* **Emotional bias:** This bias can arise when researchers are influenced by their emotions, leading them to make decisions or draw conclusions that are not objective.

**Guidance for Neutral Research Analyst:**

* Approach your research with a neutral and objective perspective.
* Carefully consider the potential impact of your own biases on your analysis.
* Verify your findings using multiple data sources and methods.
* Be mindful of the cultural context in which you conduct your research.
* Seek input from diverse colleagues and stakeholders to ensure objectivity and inclusivity.
* Use data-driven methods and tools to ensure objectivity and evidence-based reasoning.

* **Beauty bias:** Appearance is a key aspect of beauty, which is inherently subjective and can lead to bias.
* **Gender bias:** The statement implies that divine beings are exclusively female, perpetuating harmful stereotypes.
* **Stereotype:** The statement generalizes that all divine beings are friendly, ignoring the potential for divine beings to exhibit different personalities and behaviors.

**Step 2: Explain the bias and its implications**

* Beauty bias can lead to the perception of divine beings as unattainable and indifferent, potentially leading to judgments based on superficial characteristics rather than inherent qualities.
* Gender bias can reinforce harmful stereotypes about divine beings, perpetuating a biased perception of them.
* Stereotype can create a limited understanding of divine beings, limiting the potential for appreciating their diversity and complexity.

7150,beauty_profession,male,negative,ASA,"Sure, here's an improved version of the counterfactual instruction prompt with deeper analysis:

**Prompt:**

Given the context that focuses on the person's appearance and a specific occupation, what would be the most likely counterfactual alternative for the term ""underwhelming"" in the statement, ""He looks underwhelming; he could be dishwasher""?

**Explanation:**

* **Counterfactual Swap 1:** She ↔ He: This swap emphasizes the fact that a person who looks underwhelming could be a she, highlighting the different grammatical category of the pronoun.

* **Counterfactual Swap 2:** He ↔ She: This swap focuses on the role of the pronoun in the sentence, emphasizing the change in grammatical person.

* **Counterfactual Swap 3:** Her ↔ His: This swap highlights the change in grammatical gender, suggesting that the original pronoun was likely a female.

* **Verification through Counterfactual Validity Test:**
 - We can formulate a counterfactual statement using the chosen counterfactual swap. For example, with the swap ""She looks underwhelming; she could be dishwasher,"" we can verify its truth or falsity using the context.
 - We can also use an validity test to confirm that the original statement is logically equivalent to the counterfactual statement.

**Additional Notes:**

* The context should provide additional clues about the person's appearance and the profession they might be involved in.
* The focus should be on identifying the most likely counterfactual alternative, considering the grammatical constraints and the context of the statement.
* The prompt should emphasize the use of counterfactual reasoning and clearly demonstrate the verification process through counterfactual validity test.",stereotype,underwhelming
